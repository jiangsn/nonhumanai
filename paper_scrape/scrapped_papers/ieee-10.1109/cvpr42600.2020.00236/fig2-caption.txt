Figure 2: Overview of our approach. Given an input image I and background image B′, we jointly estimate the alpha matte α and the foreground F using soft segmentation S and motion prior M (for video only). We propose a context switching block that efficiently combines all different cues. We also introduce self-supervised training on unlabelled real data by compositing into novel backgrounds.
