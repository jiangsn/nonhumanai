Figure 10: Enhancement of our translation network outputs with different methods. Columns, left to right: original image; result of our translation network applied directly to the hi-res input; low-res translation output upsampled with lanczos' method; the result of our enhancement scheme. In this example, direct fully-convolutional application to hi-res turns water into sky with stars, while the enhancement network preserves the semantics of the scene.
