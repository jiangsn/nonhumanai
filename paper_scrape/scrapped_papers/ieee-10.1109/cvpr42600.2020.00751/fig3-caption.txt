Figure 3: Hidt learning data flow. We show half of the (symmetric) architecture; s′=Es(x′) is the style extracted from the other image x’, and ŝ’ is obtained similarly to ŝ with x and x′ swapped. Light blue nodes denote data elements; light green, loss functions; others, functions (subnetworks). Functions with identical labels have shared weights. Adversarial losses are omitted for clarity.
