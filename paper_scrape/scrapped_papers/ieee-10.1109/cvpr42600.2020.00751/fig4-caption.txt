Figure 4: Enhancement scheme: the input is split into subimages (color-coded) that are translated individually by hidt at medium resolution. The outputs are then merged using the merging network Genh. For illustration purposes, we show upsampling by a factor of two, but in the experiments we use a factor of four. We also apply bilinear downsampling (with shifts - see text for detail) rather than strided subsampling when decomposing the input into medium resolution images.
