Figure 3: 
Our MONO2BINAURAL deep network takes a mixed monaural audio and its accompanying visual frame as input, and predicts a two-channel binaural audio output that satisfies the visual spatial configurations. An ImageNet pre-trained ResNet-18 network is used to extract visual features, and a U-NET is used to extract audio features and perform joint audio-visual analysis. We predict a complex mask for the audio difference signal, then combine it with the input mono audio to restore the left and right channels, respectively. At test time, the input is single-channel monaural audio.
