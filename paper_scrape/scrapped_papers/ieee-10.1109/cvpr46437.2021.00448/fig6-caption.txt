Figure 6. 
Video editing with Omnimattes. Effects such as "color pop" (left; subject in color, background in grayscale), background replacement (center), and stroboscopic photography (right) all benefit from capturing the subjects’ associated effects with an Omnimatte. Note the color pop present in the flamingo’s reflection and the correct placement of shadows in the background replacement and stroboscopic photograph examples. See the SM for the full details and before/after videos.
