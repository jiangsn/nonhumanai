Table 1. Main results. For each training run, we selected the training snapshot with the lowest fid. We computed each metric 10 times with different random seeds and report their average. Path length corresponds to the PPL metric, computed based on path endpoints in \mathcal{W} [21], without the central crop used by karras et al. [21]. The FFHQ dataset contains 70k images, and the discriminator saw 25M images during training. For LSUN CAR the numbers were 893k and 57m. ↑ indicates that higher is better, and ↓ that lower is better.
