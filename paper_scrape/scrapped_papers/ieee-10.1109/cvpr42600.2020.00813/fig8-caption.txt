Figure 8. Contribution of each resolution to the output of the generator as a function of training time. The vertical axis shows a breakdown of the relative standard deviations of different resolutions, and the horizontal axis corresponds to training progress, measured in millions of training images shown to the discriminator. We can see that in the beginning the network focuses on low-resolution images and progressively shifts its focus on larger resolutions as training progresses. In (a) the generator basically outputs a 5122 image with some minor sharpening for 10242, while in (b) the larger network focuses more on the high-resolution details.
