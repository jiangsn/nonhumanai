Figure 7. Three generator (above the dashed line) and discriminator architectures. Up and down denote bilinear up and downsampling, respectively. In residual networks these also include 1Ã—1 convolutions to adjust the number of feature maps. Trgb and frgb convert between RGB and high-dimensional per-pixel data. Architectures used in configs E and F are shown in green.
