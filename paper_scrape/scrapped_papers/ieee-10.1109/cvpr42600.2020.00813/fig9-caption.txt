Figure 9. Example images and their projected and re-synthesized counterparts. For each configuration, top row shows the target images and bottom row shows the synthesis of the corresponding projected latent vector and noise inputs. With the baseline StyleGAN, projection often finds a reasonably close match for generated images, but especially the backgrounds differ from the originals. The images generated using StyleGAN2 can be projected almost perfectly back into generator inputs, while projected real images (from the training set) show clear differences to the originals, as expected. All tests were done using the same projection method and hyperparameters.
