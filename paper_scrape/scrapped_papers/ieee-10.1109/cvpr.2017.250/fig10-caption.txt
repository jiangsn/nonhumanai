Figure 10: Our method successfully reconstructs high-quality textured face models on a wide variety of people from challenging unconstrained images. We compare the estimated low-frequency albedo map based on PCA model fitting (second column) and our synthesized high-frequency albedo map (third column). Photorealistic renderings are produced using the commercial arnold renderer [46] and only the estimated shape and synthesized texture map.
