Overview. Kit heightmap (Ikit) and object heightmap (Iobj) are generated from a visual observation of the workspace. They are fed to the place and suction modules respectively to produce dense probability maps of place P and suction S success. In parallel, the matching module ingests both kit and object heightmaps to produce kit and object descriptor maps µkit and µobj which are fed along with P and S to the planner. The planner integrates this information to produce a picking location p, a placing location q, and an angle θ encoding the end-effector rotation about the z-axis.
