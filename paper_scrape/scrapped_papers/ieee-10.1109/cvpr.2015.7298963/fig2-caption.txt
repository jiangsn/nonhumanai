Figure 2. Parameterization of our layout task. Using projective geometry, y4 can be computed from parameters y1,y2,y3 and a known apartment height h Further, given intersection points p] and p2 we can compute the left bottom coordinate of the left wall using the aspect ratio from the floor plan. Our layout configuration is valid if the ray through vp1and pleft lies outside the image.
