Figure 9. Room layout estimation and room-apartment alignment with our model. The top row of images color code the estimated vertical walls, and ground-truth layout is shown with dashed lines. In the bottom row, we show the floor plans with predicted and GT alignments. The solid colors show the alignment predicted by the model, where the yellow solid line denotes the alignment prediction for the front face. Similarly, GT alignment is shown with dashed lines. A red point shows the GT location of the camera, and the arrow is the viewing direction. Green point and line is our estimated localization. On the right we show a failed example due to a weird shape of the room.
