Figure 8. For different settings of our model, “window+aspect”, “window+aspect+scene”, “window+aspect+room”, as well as for GT we illustrate the apartment reconstructions in 3d. Below each we provide the numbers of how many images and walls were matched correctly: “x images out of y” means that out of a total of y indoor photos for this apartment. x of them have correct front-wall alignment. “a walls out of b” means that out of a total of b visible walls, a of them are correctly aligned.
