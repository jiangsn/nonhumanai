Figure 10: Reconstruction based on flash and no-flash image pair. The deep image prior allows to obtain low-noise reconstruction with the lighting very close to the no-flash image. It is more successful at avoiding “leaks” of the lighting patterns from the flash pair than joint bilateral filtering [26] (c.f. Blue inset).
