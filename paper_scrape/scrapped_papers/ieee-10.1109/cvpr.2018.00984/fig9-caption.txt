Figure 9: AlexNet inversion. Given the image on the left, we show the natural pre-image obtained by inverting different layers of AlexNet (trained for classification on ImageNet ISLVRC) using three different regularizers: The deep image prior, the TV norm prior of [21], and the network trained to invert representations on a hold-out set [8]. The reconstructions obtained with the deep image prior are in many ways at least as natural as [8], yet they are not biased by the learning process.
