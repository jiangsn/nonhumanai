Figure 3: Blind restoration of a JPEG-compressed image. (electronic zoom-in recommended) Our approach can restore an image with a complex degradation (JPEG compression in this case). As the optimization process progresses, the deep image prior allows to recover most of the signal while getting rid of halos and blockiness (after 2400 iterations) before eventually overfitting to the input (at 50K iterations).
