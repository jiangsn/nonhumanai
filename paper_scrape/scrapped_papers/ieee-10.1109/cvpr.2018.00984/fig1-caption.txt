Figure 1: Super-resolution using the deep image prior. Our method uses a randomly-initialized ConvNet to upsample an image, using its structure as an image prior; similar to bicubic upsampling, this method does not require learning, but produces much cleaner results with sharper edges. In fact, our results are quite close to state-of-the-art super-resolution methods that use ConvNets learned from large datasets. The deep image prior works well for all inverse problems we could test.
