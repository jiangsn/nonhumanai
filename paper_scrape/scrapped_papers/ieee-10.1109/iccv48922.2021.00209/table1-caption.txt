Our three methods for combining StyleGAN and CLIP. The latent step inferred by the optimizer and the mapper depends on the input image, but the training is only done once per text prompt. The global direction method requires a one-time preprocessing, after which it may be applied to different (image, text prompt) pairs. Times are for a single NVIDIA GTX 1080Ti GPU.
