Fig.Â 7. Visualization of the learned filter sets for (a) 2 \times
, (b) 3 \times and
 (c) 4 \times upscaling, learned from using an
 angle, strength, and coherence based hashing scheme. Per each subset of filters, the angle varies from left to right;
 the top, middle, and bottom 3 rows correspond to low, medium and high coherence. Within each set of 3 rows, gradient
 strength increases from top to bottom. As can be inferred, the general trend is that as coherence increases, the
 directionality of the filter increases. Also, as strength increases the intensity of the filter increases. Notice how
 the 3 \times and 4 \times upscaling filters are not simply scaled versions of
 the 2 \times filters, but also have extracted
 additional information from the training data.
