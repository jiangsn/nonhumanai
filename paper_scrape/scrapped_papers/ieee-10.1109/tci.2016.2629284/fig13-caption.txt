Fig.Â 13. Quantitative comparison between the restoration performance vs. runtime. The vertical coordinate of each
 point in the scatter plots corresponds to the average PSNR (a,c,e) and SSIM (b,d,f) of each method, measured on the
 test images of Set5 and Set14. The horizontal coordinate corresponds to the average runtime (the average size of the
 upscaled images is about  0.63\times 10^6
 pixels). The size of each point reflects the standard error of the PSNR/SSIM. Detailed quantitative results can be
 found in the supplementary material, https://goo.gl/D0ETxG.
