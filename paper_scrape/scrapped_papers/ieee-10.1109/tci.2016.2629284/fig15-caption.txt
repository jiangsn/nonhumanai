Fig. 15. Visual illustration of the evolution of \mathsf{{Butterfly}}
 image throughout the different blocks of RAISR, along with a demonstration of the built-in
 sharpening effect. (a) The original HR image, (b) Bicubic interpolation by a factor of 2 of the input LR image, (c)
 Filtered image – the filters do not include a built-in sharpening, (d) Filtered image – the filters map
 the initial interpolated image to its sharpened HR version, (e) blending result of the image in (b) with the one in
 (c), and (f) blending result of the image in (b) with the one in (d).
