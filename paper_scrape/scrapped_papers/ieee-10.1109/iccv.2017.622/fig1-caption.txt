Figure 1: An example video from our database, captioned “picking [something] up”. Crowd-workers are asked to record videos and to complete caption-templates, by providing appropriate input-text for placeholders. In this example, the text provided for placeholder “something” is “a shoe”. We plan to increase the complexity and sophistication of caption-templates over time, to the degree that models succeed at making predictions.
