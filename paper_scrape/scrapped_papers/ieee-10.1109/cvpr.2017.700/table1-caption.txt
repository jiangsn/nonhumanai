Table 1. Single-view depth results on the KITTI dataset [15] using the split of eigen et al. [7] (baseline numbers taken from [16]). For training, K = KITTI, and CS = cityscapes [5]. All methods we compare with use some form of supervision (either ground-truth depth or calibrated camera pose) during training. Note: Results from garg et al. [14] are capped at 50m depth, so we break these out separately in the lower part of the table.
