Figure 4. Network architecture for our depth/pose/explainability prediction modules. The width and height of each rectangular block indicates the output channels and the spatial dimension of the feature map at the corresponding layer respectively, and each reduction/increase in size indicates a change by the factor of 2. (a) For single-view depth, we adopt the DispNet[35] architecture with multi-scale side predictions. The kernel size is 3 for all the layers except for the first 4 conv layers with 7, 7, 5, 5, respectively. The number of output channels for the first conv layer is 32. (b) The pose and explainabilty networks share the first few conv layers, and then branch out to predict 6-DoF relative pose and multi-scale explainability masks, respectively. The number of output channels for the first conv layer is 16, and the kernel size is 3 for all the layers except for the first two conv and the last two deconv/prediction layers where we use 7, 5, 5, 7, respectively. See Section 3.5 for more details.
