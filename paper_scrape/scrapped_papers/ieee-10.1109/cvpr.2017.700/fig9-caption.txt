Figure 9. Absolute trajectory error (ate) at different left/right turning magnitude (coordinate difference in the side-direction between the start and ending frame of a testing sequence). Our method performs significantly better than ORB-SLAM (short) when side rotation is small, and is comparable with ORB-SLAM (full) across the entire spectrum.
