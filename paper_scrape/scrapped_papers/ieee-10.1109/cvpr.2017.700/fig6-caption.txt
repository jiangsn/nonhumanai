Figure 6. Comparison of single-view depth estimation between eigen et al. [7] (with ground-truth depth supervision), garg et al. [14] (with ground-truth pose supervision), and ours (unsupervised). The ground-truth depth map is interpolated from sparse measurements for visualization purpose. The last two rows show typical failure cases of our model, which sometimes struggles in vast open scenes and objects close to the front of the camera.
