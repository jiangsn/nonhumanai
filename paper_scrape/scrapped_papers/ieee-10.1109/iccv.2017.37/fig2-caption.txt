Figure 2: An overview of our neural network architecture. Given input frames I1 and I2, an encoder-decoder network extracts features that are given to four sub-networks that each estimate one of the four 1D kernels for each output pixel in a dense pixel-wise manner. The estimated pixel-dependent kernels are then convolved with the input frames to produce the interpolated frame I^. Note that âˆ— denotes a local convolution.
