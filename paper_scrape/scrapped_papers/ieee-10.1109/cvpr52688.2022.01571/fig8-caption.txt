Figure 8. Synthetic defocus examples. In this nighttime garden scene (a), ldr nerf cannot accurately render defocused bright highlights since it is trained on images that have already been tonemapped and clipped (b). Rawnerf recovers the linear intensity of the light sources such that applying defocus blur produces correctly oversaturated “bokeh balls” (c). Since rawnerf is optimized for view synthesis from wide-baseline inputs, it can achieve 3d defocus effects not possible with a single image and depth map, such as revealing occluded parts of the background by focusing behind the foreground bulldozer (d) or focusing on the bookshelves reflected above the piano keys (e).
