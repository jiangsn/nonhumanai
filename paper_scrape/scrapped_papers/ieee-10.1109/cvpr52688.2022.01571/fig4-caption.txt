Figure 4. This challenging scene (a) has a 7000Ã— ratio between its 90th and 10th raw color percentiles. (b) When faced with such high-contrast inputs, the standard l2 loss from nerf manages to recover the bright parts of the scene but produces poor results in darker regions, which becomes particularly apparent after ldr tonemapping. (c) Our proposed loss (4), reweighted according to the gradient of a log tonemap curve, successfully reconstructs all parts of the scene. Both rendered images are tonemapped using HDR+ [21] for visualization.
