Figure 2. Failure modes of nerf on a daytime indoor scene. (a) Here we show two exposures (24Ã—apart) of a full rawnerf output rendering, both passed through a global tonemapping curve. Training nerf with postprocessed ldr images, as done in prior work, (b) prevents it from recovering bright highlights clipped above at 1, resulting in the missing car outside the window, and (c) corrupts the per-pixel noise distribution such that nerf recovers incorrect colors due to the nonlinear tonemap and clipping below at 0, particularly in dark regions around the plant and sofa. In contrast, rawnerf trains directly on hdr linear raw images and correctly recovers the radiance distribution in both extremely bright and extremely dark parts of the scene.
