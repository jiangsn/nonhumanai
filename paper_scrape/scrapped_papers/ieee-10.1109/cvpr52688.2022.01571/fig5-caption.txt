Figure 5. A fixed shutter speed is not sufficient for capturing the full dynamic range in scenes with extreme brightness variation. (a) For example, this scene requires variable exposure capture to avoid either poor quality in dark indoor regions or blown-out sky highlights. Only a rawnerf model optimized using both short and long exposures recovers the full dynamic range. (b) This brightness variation is too high to visualize in a single image using a simple global srgb gamma curve, requiring a more sophisticated local tonemapping algorithm (e.g., HDR+ postprocessing [21]).
