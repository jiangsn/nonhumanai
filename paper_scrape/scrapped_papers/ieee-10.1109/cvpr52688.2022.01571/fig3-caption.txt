Figure 3. The standard nerf training pipeline (a) takes in ldr images that have been sent through a camera processing pipeline, reconstructing the scene and rendering new views in ldr color space. As such, its renderings are effectively already postprocessed and cannot be significantly retouched. In contrast, our method rawnerf (b) modifies nerf to train directly on linear raw hdr input data. The resulting scene representation produces novel views that can be edited like any raw photograph.
