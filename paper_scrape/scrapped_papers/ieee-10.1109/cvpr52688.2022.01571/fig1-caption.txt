Figure 1. By jointly optimizing a single scene representation over many input images, nerf is surprisingly robust to high levels of image noise. We exploit this fact to train rawnerf directly on completely unprocessed hdr linear raw images. In this nighttime scene lit only by a single candle (a), rawnerf can extract details from the noisy raw data that would have been destroyed by postprocessing (b, c). Rawnerf recovers full hdr color information, enabling hdr view synthesis tasks such as changing focus and exposure for rendered novel views. The resulting renderings can be retouched like any raw photograph: here we show (d, left) a dark all-in-focus exposure with a simple global tonemap and (d, right) a brighter, synthetically refocused exposure postprocessed by hdrnet [18]. See our supplementary video for more results.
