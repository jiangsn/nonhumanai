Figure 3. Triangle mesh extraction from a set of 256 rendered images w/ masks. Damicornis model from the smithsonian 3d repository [55], we extracted meshes from nerf and neus using marching cubes for a target triangle count of roughly 50k triangles and optimized the example in our pipeline for a similar count. We show renderings of the extracted meshes in a path tracer and report the chamfer loss. We note that neus, which optimizes a surface representation, significantly improves on the volumetric representation used by nerf for this example. Furthermore, our end-to-end optimization of a triangle mesh improves both the visual quality and the chamfer loss at a fixed triangle count. When drastically increasing the triangle count in the neus mesh extraction (from 53k to 900k triangles), the quality improves significantly, indicating that neus has a high quality internal surface representation. Still, our mesh with 53k triangles is on par with the high resolution neus output, indicating the benefit of directly optimizing the mesh representation.
