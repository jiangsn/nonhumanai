Figure 2. Overview of our approach. We learn topology, materials, and environment map lighting jointly from 2d supervision. We leverage differentiable marching tetrahedrons to directly optimize topology of a triangle mesh. While the topology is drastically changing, we learn materials through volumetric texturing, efficiently encoded using an mlp with positional encoding. Finally, we introduce a differentiable version of the split sum approximation for environment lighting. Our output representation is a triangle mesh with spatially varying 2d textures and a high dynamic range environment map, which can be used unmodified in standard game engines. The system is trained end-to-end, supervised by loss in image space, with gradient-based optimization of all stages. Spot model by keegan crane.
