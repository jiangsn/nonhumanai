Figure 11. Environment lighting approximated with spherical gaussians using 128 lobes vs. Split sum. The training set consists of 256 path traced images with monte carlo sampled environment lighting using a high resolution hdr probe. We assume known geometry and optimize materials and lighting using identical settings for both methods. Reported image metrics are the arithmetic mean of the 16 (novel) views in the test set. Note that the split sum approximation is able to capture high frequency lighting. Probe from poly haven [67].
