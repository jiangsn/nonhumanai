Table 2. Relighting quality for nerfactor's synthetic dataset. The reported image metrics are the arithmetic mean over 8 validation views and 8 light probes for all 4 test scenes. We also show metrics for the \boldsymbol{k}_{d} (albedo) textures. Following nerfactor, we note that the scale factor between material and lighting is indeterminable and therefore normalize albedo images by the average intensity of the reference before measuring errors.
