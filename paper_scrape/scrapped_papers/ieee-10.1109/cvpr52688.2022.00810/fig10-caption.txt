Figure 10. Reconstruction from photographs (datasets from nerd), comparing our results with nerd and nerf. Images in the two rightmost colums were provided by the nerd authors. We score higher in terms of image metrics, most likely due to our mesh representation enforcing opaque geometry, where competing algorithms rely on volumetric opacity. Despite inconsistencies in camera poses and masks, our results remain sharp while nerf and nerd suffer from floating or missing geometry.
