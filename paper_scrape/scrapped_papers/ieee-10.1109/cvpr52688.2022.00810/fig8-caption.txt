Figure 8. To highlight the benefits of our explicit representation, we insert two reconstructed models into the cornell box. Note that the objects accurately interact with the scene lighting, and cast shadows (e.g., the green wall). Next, we use our reconstructed hotdog model in a soft-body physics simulation, dropping red jelly on the plate. We run the entire simulation (21 frames) on both the reference 3d mesh and our reconstructed mesh, and display the last frame. Note that these applications are not currently feasible for neural volumetric representations.
