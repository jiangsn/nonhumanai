Figure 6. Application of a network trained on SID to a low-light raw image taken with an iphone 6s smartphone. (a) A raw image captured at night with an iphone 6s with ISO 400, aperture f/2.2, and exposure time 0.05s. This image was processed by the traditional image processing pipeline and scaled to match the brightness of the reference image. (b) The output of our network, with amplification ratio x100.
