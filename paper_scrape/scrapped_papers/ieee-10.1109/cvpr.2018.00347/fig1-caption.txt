Figure 1. Extreme low-light imaging with a convolutional network. Dark indoor environment. The illuminance at the camera is < 0.1 lux. The sony Î±7S II sensor is exposed for 1/30 second. (a) Image produced by the camera with ISO 8,000. (b) Image produced by the camera with ISO 409,600. The image suffers from noise and color bias. (c) Image produced by our convolutional network applied to the raw sensor data from (a).
