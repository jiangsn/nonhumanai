Figure 5. (a) An image captured at night by the fujifilm X-t2 camera with ISO 800, aperture f/7.1, and exposure of 1/30 second. The illuminance at the camera is approximately 1 lux. (b) Processing the raw data by a traditional pipeline does not effectively handle the noise and color bias in the data. (c) Our result obtained from the same raw data.
