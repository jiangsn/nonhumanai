Figure 9: 
Our model attains multimodal synthesis capability when trained with the image encoder. During deployment, by using different random noise, our model synthesizes outputs with diverse appearances but all having the same semantic layouts depicted in the input mask. For reference, the ground truth image is shown inside the input segmentation mask.
