In the SPADE generator, each normalization layer uses the segmentation mask to modulate the layer activations. (left) Structure of one residual block with SPADE, (right) The generator contains a series of SPADE residual blocks with upsampling layers. Our architecture achieves better performance with a smaller number of parameters by removing the downsampling layers of leading image-to-image translation networks (pix2pixHD [45]).
