Fig. 9: Two regions of interest defined at areas which should have been unreachable for the player. The buffer of visited states (red cubes) allows us to see that the region to the left remained unexplored while the region to the right was reachable somehow. The trajectories recorded while training, however, allow us to easily visualize how the agents did manage to break into that region and could help the designers to correct any oversight.
