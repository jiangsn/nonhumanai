Fig. 14: Visualizing areas where players could get stuck. The purple areas are intentionally introduced surfaces which freeze the player in place if they come in contact. The green blocks represent the outliers encountered in the distribution of terminal states and highlight the locations around the map which could be problematic. Figure (a) shows two additional blocks between two platforms which were caused by the agents falling in the gap and getting stuck. This was a design oversight which was not intentionally introduced into the game and which was identified thanks to these visualizations. Figure (c), on the contrary, shows a region in the map which was designed for the agents to get trapped if they fell into it.
