Figure 3: Samples of predicted visibility maps (best viewed in color), where t=0.5. The arms move downwards from T=0 to T=1. So the area right above the arm at T=0 is visible at t but the area right above the arm at T=1 is occluded (i.e., invisible) at t. The visibility maps in the fourth row clearly show this phenomenon. The white area around arms in Vt‚Üê0 indicate such pixels in I0 contribute most to the synthesized I^t while the occluded pixels in I1 have little contribution. Similar phenomena also happen around motion boundaries (e.g., around bodies of the athletes).
