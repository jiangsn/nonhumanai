Figure 1. If you look at the person on the left picture, you might think she is playing Pacman of Toru Iwatani, but she is not! She is actually playing with a GAN generated version of Pacman. In this paper, we introduce GameGAN that learns to reproduce games by just observing lots of playing rounds. Moreover, our model can disentangle background from dynamic objects, allowing us to create new games by swapping components as shown in the center and right images.
