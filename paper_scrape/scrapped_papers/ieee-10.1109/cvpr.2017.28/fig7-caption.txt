Figure 7. Qualitative results. We compare with scene completion results from Zheng et al. [37] and Firman et al. [3] (on a subset of the test set), and semantic scene completion results from Lin et al. [18] and Geiger and Wang [4]. Zheng et al. [3] tested on rendered depth, [18] and [4] tested on RGB-D frame from kinect, [3] and SSCNet tested on kinect depth. Overall, SSCNet gives more accurate voxel predictions such as the lamps and pillows in the first row, and the sofa in the third row.
