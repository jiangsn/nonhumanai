Figure 1. Semantic scene completion. (a) Input single-view depth map (b) Visible surface from the depth map; color is for visualization only. (c) Semantic scene completion result: Our model jointly predicts volumetric occupancy and object categories for each of the 3D voxels in the view frustum. Note that the entire volume occupied by the bed is predicted to have the bed category.
