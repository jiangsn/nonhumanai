Figure 4. Comparison of receptive fields and voxel sizes between SSCNet and prior work. (a) Object centric networks such as [34] and [20] scale objects into the same 3D voxel grid thus discarding physical size information. In (b)-(d), Colored regions indicate the effective receptive field of a single neuron in the last layer of each 3D convnet. With the help of 3D dilated convolution SSCNet drastically increases its receptive field compared to other 3D convnet architectures [31], [36] thus capturing richer 3D contextual information.
