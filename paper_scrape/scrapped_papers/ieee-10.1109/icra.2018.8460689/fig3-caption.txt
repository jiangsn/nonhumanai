Fig. 3 Sample execution trace of NTP on a block stacking task. The task is to stack lettered blocks into a specified configuration (block_D on top of block_E, block_B on top of block_d, etc). Top-level program block_stacking takes in the entire demonstration as input (red window), and predicts the next sub-program to run is pick_and_place, and it should take the part of task specification marked by the orange window as the input specification. The bottom-level API call moves the robot and close / open the gripper. When end of program (eop) is true, the current program stops and return its caller program.
