Fig. 7 NTP with visual state: NTPVID (detector) uses an object detector on images which is subsequently used as state in ntp. NTP (e2e) is an end-to-end model trained completely on images with no low-level state information. We note that in the partial observation case (only video), similar learning trends were observed as compared to fully observed case (ntp (full state)), albeit with a decrease in performance.
