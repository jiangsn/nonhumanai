Figure 1: 
Full-frame video stabilization of challenging videos. Our method takes a shaky input video (top) and produces a stabilized and distortion-free video (bottom), as indicated by less fluctuation in the yá„‘t epipolar plane image. Furthermore, by robustly fusing multiple neighboring frames, our results do not suffer from aggressive cropping of frame borders in the stabilized video and can even expand the field of view of the original video. Our approach significantly outperforms representative state-of-the-art video stabilization algorithms on these challenging scenarios (see Figure 1).
