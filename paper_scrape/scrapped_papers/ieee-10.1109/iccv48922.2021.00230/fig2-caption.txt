Limitations of current state-of-the-art video stabilization techniques. (a) Current commercial video stabilization software (Adobe Premiere Pro 2020) fails to generate smooth videos in challenging scenarios of rapid camera shakes. (b) Yu and Ramamoorthiâ€™s method [70] produces a temporally smooth video. However, the warped (stabilized) video contains many missing pixels at frame borders and inevitably requires applying aggressive cropping (green checkerboard areas) to generate a rectangular video. (c) The DIFRINT method [10] achieves full-frame video stabilization by iteratively applying frame interpolation to generate in-between, stabilized frames. However, interpolating between frames with large camera motion and moving occlusion is challenging. Their results are thus prone to severe artifacts.
