Design choices for fusing multiple frames. To synthesize a full-frame stabilized video, we need to align and fuse the contents from multiple neighboring frames in the input shaky video. (a) Conventional panorama image stitching (or in general image-based rendering) methods often fuse the warped (stabilized) images in the image level. Fusing in image-level works well when the alignment is accurate, but may generate blending artifacts (e.g., visible seams) when flow estimates are not reliable. (b) One can also encode the images as abstract CNN features, perform the fusion in the feature-space, and learn a decoder to convert the fused feature to output frames. Such approaches are more robust to flow inaccuracy but often produce overly blurred images. (c) Our proposed hybrid fusion combines the advantages of both strategies. We first extract abstract image features (Eq. (1)). We then fuse the warped features from multiple frames. For each source frame, we take the fused feature map together with the individual warped features and decode it to the output frames and the associated confidence maps. Finally, we produce the final output frame by using the weighted average of the generated images as in Eq. (4).
