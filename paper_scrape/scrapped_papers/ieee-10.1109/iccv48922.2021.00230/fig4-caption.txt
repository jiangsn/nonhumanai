Learning-based fusion. Given the warped features {\left\{ {f_{{n^s}}^{{k^t}}} \right\}_{n \in {\Omega _k}}} (or warped images for image-space fusion), warping masks {\left\{ {M_{{n^s}}^{{k^t}}} \right\}_{n \in {\Omega _k}}}, and the flow error maps {\left\{ {e_{{n^s}}^{{k^t}}} \right\}_{n \in {\Omega _k}}}, we first concatenate feature, warping mask, and flow erro maps for each frame (shown as dotted blocks). We then use a CNN to predict the blending weights \omega _{{n^s}}^{{k^t}} for each neighbor frame. Using the predicted weights, we compute the fused feature by weighted averaging the individual warped features {\left\{ {f_{{n^s}}^{{k^t}}} \right\}_{n \in {\Omega _k}}}.
