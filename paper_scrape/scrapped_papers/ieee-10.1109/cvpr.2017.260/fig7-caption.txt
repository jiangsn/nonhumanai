Figure 7: Results of the joint scene optimization step. (Column 1) The initial object placement in the scene. (Columns 2â€“5) Rendering of the scene in sample iterations during optimization. (Column 5) The last iteration of optimization. (Last column) The objective function error and the optimization convergence. The objective function minimizes dis-similarity between the real and the rendered image. Red dots show the sample iterations that are shown above.
