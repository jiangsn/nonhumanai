Fig. 9. Natural image of the dog class that can be perturbed to all other nine classes. The attack is conducted over the AllConv network using the proposed one pixel attack. The table in the bottom shows the class labels output by the target DNN, all with approximately 100% confidence. This curious result further emphasize the difference and limitations of current methods when compared to human recognition.
