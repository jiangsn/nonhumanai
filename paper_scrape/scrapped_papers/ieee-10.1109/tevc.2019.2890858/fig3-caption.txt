Fig. 3. Illustration of the adversarial images generated by using Jacobian saliency-map approach [18]. The perturbation is conducted on about 4% of the total pixels and can be obvious to human eyes. Since the adversarial pixel perturbation has become a common way of generating adversarial images, such abnormal “noise” might be recognized with expertise.
