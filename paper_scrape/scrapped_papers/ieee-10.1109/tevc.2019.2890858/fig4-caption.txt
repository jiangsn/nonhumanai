Fig. 4. Illustration of using one and two-pixel perturbation attack in a 3-D input space (i.e., the image has three pixels). The green point (sphere) denotes a natural image. In the case of one-pixel perturbation, the search space is the three perpendicular lines that intersect at point of natural image, which are denoted by red and black stripes. For two-pixel perturbation, the search space is the three blue (shaded) 2-D planes. In summary, one- and two-pixel attacks search the perturbation on, respectively, 1-D and 2-D slices of the original 3-D input space.
