Figure 3: Network architecture of our generator. We first train a residual network G1 on lower resolution images. Then, another residual network G2 is appended to G1 and the two networks are trained jointly on high resolution images. Specifically, the input to the residual blocks in G2 is the element-wise sum of the feature map from G2 and the last feature map from G1.
