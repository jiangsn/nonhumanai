Figure 1: We propose a generative adversarial framework for synthesizing 2048Ã—1024 images from semantic label maps (lower left corner in (a)). Compared to previous work [5], our results express more natural textures and details. (b) We can change labels in the original label map to create new scenes, like replacing trees with buildings. (c) Our framework also allows the user to edit the appearance of individual objects in the scene, e.g. Changing the color of a car or the texture of a road. Please visit our website for more side-by-side comparisons as well as interactive editing demos.
