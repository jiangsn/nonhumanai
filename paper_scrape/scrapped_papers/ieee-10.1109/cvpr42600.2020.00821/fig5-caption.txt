Figure 5. Qualitative comparison of latent-guided image synthesis results on the celeba-hq and AFHQ datasets. Each method translates the source images (left-most column) to target domains using randomly sampled latent codes. (a) The top three rows correspond to the results of converting male to female and vice versa in the bottom three rows. (b) Every two rows from the top show the synthesized images in the following order: cat-to-dog, dog-to-wildlife, and wildlife-to-cat.
