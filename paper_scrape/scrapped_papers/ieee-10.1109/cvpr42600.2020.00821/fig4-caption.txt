Figure 4. Reference-guided image synthesis results on celeba-hq. The source and reference images in the first row and the first column are real images, while the rest are images generated by our proposed model, stargan v2. Our model learns to transform a source image reflecting the style of a given reference image. High-level semantics such as hairstyle, makeup, beard and age are followed from the reference images, while the pose and identity of the source images are preserved. Note that the images in each column share a single identity with different styles, and those in each row share a style with different identities.
