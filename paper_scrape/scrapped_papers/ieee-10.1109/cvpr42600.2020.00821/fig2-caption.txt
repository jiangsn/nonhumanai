Figure 2. Overview of stargan v2, consisting of four modules. (a) The generator translates an input image into an output image reflecting the domain-specific style code. (b) The mapping network transforms a latent code into style codes for multiple domains, one of which is randomly selected during training. (c) The style encoder extracts the style code of an image, allowing the generator to perform reference-guided image synthesis. (d) The discriminator distinguishes between real and fake images from multiple domains. Note that all modules except the generator contain multiple output branches, one of which is selected when training the corresponding domain.
