Randomly selected frames of Adversarial Deepfakes from successful attacks. The frame from the dataset in the first column is correctly identified as Fake by the detectors, while the corresponding frames generated by each of our attacks are labelled as Real with a probability of 1. Video examples are linked in the footnote on the first page.
