Table 2. 
Success Rate of White-box attack on XceptionNet and MesoNet. We report the average Lâˆž distortion between the adversarial and original frames and the attack success rate on uncompressed (SR-U) and compressed (SR-C) videos. Acc-C denotes the accuracy of the detector on compressed adversarial videos.
