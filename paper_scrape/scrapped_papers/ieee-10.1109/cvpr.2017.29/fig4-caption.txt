Figure 4. Which 3D patches are matched by 3DMatch? on the left, we show two fused fragments (A and B) taken at different scan view angles, as well as their registration result using 3DMatch + RANSAC. On the right, each row shows a local 3D patch from fragment A, followed by three nearest neighbor local 3D patches from fragment B found by 3DMatch descriptors. The bounding boxes are color coded to the keypoints illustrated on fragment A.
