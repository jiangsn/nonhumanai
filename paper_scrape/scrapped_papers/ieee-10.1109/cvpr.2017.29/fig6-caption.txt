Figure 6. 3DMatch for reconstructions. On the left, we show a complete reconstruction of an apartment from SUN3D [39] using only 3DMatch. On the right, we show two reconstructions using only SIFT to match color features (top), using only 3DMatch to match geometric features (middle), and using both SIFT and 3DMatch (bottom). The red boxes highlight areas with poor reconstruction quality, while the green boxes highlight areas with improved quality. These examples show that 3DMatch provides strong geometric feature correspondences that are complementary to color features and can help to improve the quality of reconstructions.
