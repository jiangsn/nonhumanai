Figure 5. Challenging cases of loop closures from test scenes of SUN3D [39]. In these instances, color features in the RGB images (top row) are insufficient for registering the scan pairs due to drastic viewpoint differences. While rusu et al. [27] fails at aligning the pairs (middle row), 3DMatch is able to successfully align each pair of scans (bottom row) by matching local geometric features.
