Fig.Â 12. Supersampling effectively reduces the approximation error. The relative errors
 are visualized as color temperature images, with red corresponding to a relative error of 10 percent, and blue 0
 percent. The supersampling rates used for fur/scene geometry are shown under each figure. From left to right, the
 quantitative RMS errors are 3.38, 2.68, 1.53 and 1.12 percent, respectively. And the rendering time is 87.8, 124.9,
 207.3 and 425.1 s, respectively.
