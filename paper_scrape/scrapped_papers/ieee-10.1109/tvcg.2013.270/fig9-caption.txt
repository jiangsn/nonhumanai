Fig. 9. Comparison between adaptive sampling and our method. Timings given below each
 column are for tracing view rays (cones). (a) using 3\times×3
 supersampling in the coarse phase and 8\times×8 in the refining
 phase produces noisy results. Some pixels, marked in red in the insets in the top row, are missed in the coarse phase
 and ignored in the refining phase. (b) this problem can only be alleviated with a 17\times×
17 coarse phase supersampling rate and such an adaptive sampling scheme hardly brings any
 performance gain. (c) our rendering result.
