Fig. 11. A dynamic scene with an animated furry character, rendered in 340.6 seconds at
 the resolution of 1,080 \times× 720 with DOF and reflection
 effects (a). The SRT algorithm takes 1,329.3 seconds to render an image (b) of comparable quality. The difference
 between the two images is visualized as color temperature (c). The RMS error is 3.38 percent.
