Fig. 14. Rendering hair with DOF (a) and motion blur (b) effects. The rendering time of
 our method is 42.5 and 173.2 s respectively. For the motion blur result, we use 13\times×
13 supersampling of the shutter open time. The stochastic ray tracing method takes 223.6
 and 368.5 s to render results of comparable quality. The hair consists of 10K fibers.
