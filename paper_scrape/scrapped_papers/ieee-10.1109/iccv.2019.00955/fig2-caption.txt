Our meta-learning architecture involves the embedder network that maps head images (with estimated face landmarks) to the embedding vectors, which contain pose-independent information. The generator network maps input face landmarks into output frames through the set of convolutional layers, which are modulated by the embedding vectors via adaptive instance normalization. During meta-learning, we pass sets of frames from the same video through the embedder, average the resulting embeddings and use them to predict adaptive parameters of the generator. Then, we pass the landmarks of a different frame through the generator, comparing the resulting image with the ground truth. Our objective function includes perceptual and adversarial losses, with the latter being implemented via a conditional projection discriminator.
