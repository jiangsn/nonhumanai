Figure 1: The figure shows a test example with a single person. It demonstrates that our system tracks the pose as the person enters the room and even when he is fully occluded behind the wall. Top: Images captured by a camera colocated with the radio sensor, and presented here for visual reference. Middle: Keypoint confidence maps extracted from RF signals alone, without any visual input. Bottom: Skeleton parsed from keypoint confidence maps showing that we can use RF signals to estimate the human pose even in the presence of full occlusion.
