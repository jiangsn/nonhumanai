Table 1. Relative speedups and memory consumption compared to mip-nerf. The proposed tri-plane representation is 3–8 × faster than a fully implicit mip-nerf network and only requires a fraction of its memory. In this example, both voxel grid and tri-plane representation use an mlp-based decoder, as indicated. The number of voxels is chosen to match the total parameters of the tri-plane representation, thus the resolution is relatively low and the memory footprint lower than mip-nerf. In the sso experiment (fig. 3), we used a larger decoder for the tri-plane representation than for the gan experiments discussed in sec. 4 to optimize expressiveness over speed for this experiment.
