Figure 4. Our 3d gan framework comprises several parts: a pose-conditioned stylegan2-based feature generator and mapping network, a tri-plane 3d representation with a lightweight feature decoder, a neural volume renderer, a superresolution module, and a pose-conditioned stylegan2 discriminator with dual discrimination. This architecture elegantly decouples feature generation and neural rendering, allowing the use of a powerful stylegan2 generator for 3d scene generalization. Moreover, the lightweight 3d tri-plane representation is both expressive and efficient in enabling high-quality 3d-aware view synthesis in real-time.
