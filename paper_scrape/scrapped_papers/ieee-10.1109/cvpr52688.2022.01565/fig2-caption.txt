Figure 2. Neural implicit representations use fully connected layers (fc) with positional encoding (pe) to represent a scene, which can be slow to query (a). Explicit voxel grids or hybrid variants using small implicit decoders are fast to query, but scale poorly with resolution (b). Our hybrid explicitimplicit tri-plane repre-sentation (c) is fast and scales efficiently with resolution, enabling greater detail for equal capacity.
