Figure 1. Face image editing results generated by our system. It can take free-form inputs consisting of masks, sketches and color. These examples show that our system allows users to easily edit the shape and color of the face, even if the user wants to completely change the hairstyle and eyes (second row). Interestingly, the user can even edit earrings with our system (third row).
