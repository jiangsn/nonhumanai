Figure 7. (a) A test-set image from our dataset's stump scene, with (b) our model's rendered image and depth map (median ray termination distance [34]). Cropped patches are shown to highlight details. Compared to prior work (c-e) our renderings more closely resemble the ground-truth and our depths look more plausible (though no ground-truth depth is available). See the supplement for more results.
