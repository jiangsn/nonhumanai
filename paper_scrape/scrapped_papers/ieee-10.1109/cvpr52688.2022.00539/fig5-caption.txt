Figure 5. Our regularizer suppresses “floaters” (pieces of semi-transparent material floating in space, which are easy to identify in the depth map) and prevents a phenomenon in which surfaces in the background “collapse” towards the camera (shown in the bottom left of (a)). The noise-injection approach of mildenhall et al. [30] only partially eliminates these artifacts, and reduces reconstruction quality (note the lack of detail in the depths of the distant trees). See the supplemental video for more visualizations.
