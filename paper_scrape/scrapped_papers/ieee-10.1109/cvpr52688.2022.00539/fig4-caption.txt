Figure 4. A visualization of the histograms (\mathbf{t}, \mathbf{w}) emitted from the NeRF MLP (black) and the two sets of histograms (\hat{\mathbf{t}},\hat{\mathbf{w}}) emit-ted by the proposal MLP (yellow and orange) for a single ray from our dataset's bicycle scene over the course of training. Below we visualize the entire ray with fixed x and y axes, but above we crop both axes to better visualize details near scene content. Histogram weights are plotted as distributions that integrate to 1. (a) When training begins, all weights are uniformly distributed with respect to ray distance t. (b, c) As training progresses, the NeRF weights begin to concentrate around a surface and the proposal weights form a kind of envelope around those NeRF weights.
