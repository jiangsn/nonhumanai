Figure 2. A 2d visualization of our scene parameterization. We define a contract (\cdot) operator (equation 10, shown as arrows) that maps coordinates onto a ball of radius 2 (orange), where points within a radius of 1 (blue) are unaffected. We apply this contraction to mip-nerf gaussians in euclidean 3d space (gray ellipses) similarly to a kalman filter to produce our contracted gaussians (red ellipses), whose centers are guaranteed to lie within a ball of radius 2. The design of contract (\cdot) combined with our choice to space ray intervals linearly according to disparity means that rays cast from a camera located at the origin of the scene will have equidistant intervals in the orange region, as demonstrated here.
