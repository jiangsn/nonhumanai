Figure 6. A visualization of \nabla\mathcal{L}_{\text{dist}}, the gradient of our regular-izer, as a function of \mathbf{s} and \mathbf{w} on a toy step function. Our loss encourages each ray to be as compact as possible by 1) minimizing the width of each interval, 2) pulling distant intervals towards each other, 3) consolidating weight into a single interval or a small number of nearby intervals, and 4) driving all weights towards zero when possible (such as when the entire ray is unoccupied).
