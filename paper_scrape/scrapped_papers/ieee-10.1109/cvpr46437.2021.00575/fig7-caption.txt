Figure 7: 
Quantitative evaluation, motion prediction: We evaluate the quality of the predicted motion by comparing the pixel positions in 60 future frames to those in the ground-truth video. We compare our proposed motion representation to three alternative methods, described in Section 7.1. The shaded region shows the range of predictions produced by Endo et al. [6]. We find that our proposed motion representation is able to most reliably reproduce the true motion information for scenes with fluid motion. All comparisons are performed on images of size 1280 Ã— 720.
