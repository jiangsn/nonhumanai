Figure 5: 
Training: As described in Section 5.1, each frame in our generated looping video is composed of textures from two warped frames. To supervise this process during training, i.e., to have a real frame to compare against, we perform our symmetric splatting using the features from two different frames, I0 and IN (instead of I0 twice, as in inference). We enforce the motion field M to match the motion estimated from the ground truth video MGT , and the output frame It to match the real video frame IGTt. For both, we use a combination of photometric and discriminative losses.
