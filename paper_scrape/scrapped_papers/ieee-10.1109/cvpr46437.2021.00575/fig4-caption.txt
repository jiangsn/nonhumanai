Figure 4: 
Seamless looping: An illustrated example of how seamless loops are created. Two feature videos are created by warping D0. The first, Vf, contains the result of integrating the motion field M, resulting in a video starting with the input image and animating into the future. The second, Vp, instead uses M, resulting in a video starting in the past and ending with the− input frame. These two videos typically contain complementary unknown regions (shown in magenta). Before decoding, we combine the two feature maps via joint splatting. We modulate the contribution of each using splatting weights αt, such that in the blended composite, the first and last frames are guaranteed to equal D0, thus ensuring a seamless loop. Note that RGB images are shown for visualization, but these are both deep feature videos.
