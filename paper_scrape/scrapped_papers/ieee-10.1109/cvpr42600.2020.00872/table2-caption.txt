Table 2: Cross-generator generalization results. We show the average precision (AP) of various classifiers from baseline zhang et al. [44] and ours, tested across 11 generators. Symbols ✓ and † mean the augmentation is applied with 50% or 10% probability, respectively, at training. Chance is 50% and best possible performance is 100%. When test generators are used in training, we show those results in gray (as they are not testing generalization). Values in black show cross-generator generalization. Amongst those, the highest value is highlighted in black. We show ablations with respect to fewer classes in progan and by removing data augmentation. We report the mean AP by averaging the AP scores over all datasets. Subsets are plotted in Figures 2, 3, 4 for comparison.
