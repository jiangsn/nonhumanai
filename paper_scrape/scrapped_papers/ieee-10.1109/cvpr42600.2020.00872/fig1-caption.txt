Figure 1: Are CNN-generated images hard to distinguish from real images? We show that a classifier trained to detect images generated by only one CNN (ProGAN, far left) can detect those generated by many other models (remaining columns). Our code and models are available at https://peterwang512.github.io/CNNDetection/.
