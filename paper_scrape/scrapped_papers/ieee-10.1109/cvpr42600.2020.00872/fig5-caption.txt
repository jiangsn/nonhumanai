Figure 5: Robustness. We show the effect of AP given test-time perturbation to (left) gaussian blurring and (right) jpeg. We show classifiers trained on progan, with different augmentations applied during training. Note that in all cases and both perturbations, when training without augmentation (red), performance degrades across all datasets when perturbations are added. In most cases, training with both augmentations, performs best or near best. Notable exceptions are for super-resolution (where no augmentation is best), and deepfake, where training only with the perturbation used during testing, rather than both, performs best.
