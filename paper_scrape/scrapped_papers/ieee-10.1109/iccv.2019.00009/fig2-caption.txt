Figure 2: Advances in the digitization of human faces have become the basis for modern facial image editing tools. The editing tools can be split in two main categories: identity modification and expression modification. Aside from manually editing the face using tools such as Photoshop, many automatic approaches have been proposed in the last few years. The most prominent and widespread identity editing technique is face swapping, which has gained significant popularity as lightweight systems are now capable of running on mobile phones. Additionally, facial reenactment techniques are now available, which alter the expressions of a person by transferring the expressions of a source person to the target.
