Figure 8: Texture synthesis example. The original texture (a) was rotated 90^{\circ} and its central region (marked by white square) was filled using the original input image. (b) Our result. (c) Best results of (our implementation of) [10] were achieved with 9\times 9 windows (the only user defined parameter). Although the window size is large, the global structure is not maintained.
