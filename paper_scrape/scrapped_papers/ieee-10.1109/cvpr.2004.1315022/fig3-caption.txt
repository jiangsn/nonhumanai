Figure 3: Local and global space-time consistency. (a) Enforcement of the global objective function of Eq. (1) requires coherence of all space-time patches containing the point pp. Such coherence leads to a globally correct solution (b). True trajectory of the moving object is marked in red and is correctly recovered. When only local constraints are used and no global consistency enforced, the resulting completion leads to inconsistencies (c). Background figure is wrongly recovered twice with wrong motion trajectories.
