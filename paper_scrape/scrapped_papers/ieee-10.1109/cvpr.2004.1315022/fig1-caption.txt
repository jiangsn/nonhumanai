Figure 1: (1) Top part of the figure shows a few frames from a 240 frame sequence showing one person standing and waving her hands while the other person is hopping behind her. (2) A zoomed-in view on a portion of the video around the space-time hole before and after the completion. Note that the recovered arms of the hopping person are at slightly different orientations than the removed ones. As this particular instance does not exist anywhere else in the sequence, a similar one from a different time instance was chosen to provide an equally likely completion.
