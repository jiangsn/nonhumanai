Fig. 1. 
Some visual results of our approach on the Human3.6M benchmark [5]. (a) illustrates the intermediate 3D poses estimated by the 2D-to-3D pose transformer module, (b) denotes the final 3D poses refined by the 3D-to-2D pose projector module, and (c) denotes the ground-truth. The estimated 3D joints are reprojected into the images and shown by themselves from the side view (next to the images). As shown, the predicted 3D poses in (b) have been significantly corrected, compared with (a). Best viewed in color. Note that, red and green indicate left and right, respectively.
