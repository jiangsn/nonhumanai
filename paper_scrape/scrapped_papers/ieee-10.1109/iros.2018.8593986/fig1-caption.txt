Fig. 1. Illustrative configuration of tightly packed blocks reflecting the kind of clutter that commonly appears in real-world scenarios (e.g. With stacks of books, boxes, etc.), which remains challenging for grasp-only manipulation policies. Our model-free system is able to plan pushing motions that isolate these objects from each other, making them easier to grasp; improving the overall stability and efficiency of picking.
