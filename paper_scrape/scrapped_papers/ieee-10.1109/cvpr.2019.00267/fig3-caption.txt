Figure 3: 
Multiple Cycles and Skip Cycles. Cycle-consistency may not be achievable due to sudden changes in object pose or occlusions. Our solution is to optimize multiple cycles of different lengths simultaneously. This allows learning from shorter cycles when the full cycle is too difficult (left). This also allows cycles that skip frames, which can deal with momentary occlusions (right).
