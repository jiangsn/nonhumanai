Method Overview. (a) During training, the model learns a feature space encoded by ϕ to perform tracking using tracker \mathcal{T}T. By tracking backward and then forward, we can use cycle-consistency to supervise learning of ϕ. Note that only the initial patch pt is explicitly encoded by ϕ; other patch features along the cycle are obtained by localizing image features. (b) We show one step of tracking back in time from t to t — 1. Given input image features x_{t - 1}^IxIt−1 and query patch features x_t^p,\mathcal{T}xpt,T localizes the patch x_{t - 1}^pxpt−1 in x_{t - 1}^IxIt−1. This operation is performed iteratively to track along the cycle in (a).
