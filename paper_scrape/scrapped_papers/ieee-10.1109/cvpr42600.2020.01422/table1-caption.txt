Table 1: Quantitative comparison of reflection removal methods on synthetic sequences. We compare the proposed method with existing reflection removal approaches on a synthetic dataset with 100 sequences, where each sequence contains five consecutive frames. For the single-image based methods [8], [16], [38], [43], [45], we generate the results frame-by-frame. For multi-frame algorithms [1], [12], [21] and our method, we use five input frames to generate the results
