Figure 2: Algorithmic overview. we reconstruct the background/reflection layers in a coarse-to-fine manner. At the coarsest level, we estimate uniform flow fields for both the background and reflection layers and then reconstruct coarse background/reflection layers by averaging the aligned frames. At level l, we apply (1) back-ground/reflection layer reconstruction modules to reconstruct the background/reflection layer, and (2) use the PWC-net to predict the refined flow fields for both layers. Our framework progressively reconstructs the back-ground/reflection layers and flow fields until the finest level.
