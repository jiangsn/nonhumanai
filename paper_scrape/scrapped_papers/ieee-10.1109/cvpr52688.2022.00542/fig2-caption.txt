Figure 2. Overview of our sparse plenoxel model. Given a set of images of an object or a scene, we optimize a (a) sparse voxel (“plenoxel”) grid with density and spherical harmonic coefficients at each voxel. To render a ray, we (b) compute the color and opacity of each sample point via trilinear interpolation of the neighboring voxel coefficients. We integrate the color and opacity of these samples using (c) differentiable volume rendering, following the recent success of NeRF [28]. The voxel coefficients can then be (d) optimized using the standard mse reconstruction loss relative to the training images, along with a total variation regularizer.
