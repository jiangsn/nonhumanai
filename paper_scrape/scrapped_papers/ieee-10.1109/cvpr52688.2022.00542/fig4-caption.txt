Figure 4. Gradient sparsity. The gradient becomes very sparse spatially within the first 12800 batches (one epoch for the synthetic scenes), with as few as 1% of the voxels updating per batch in the synthetic case. This enables efficient training via sparse parameter updates. The solid lines show the mean and the shaded regions show the full range of values among all scenes of each type.
