Figure 2: We annotate dense correspondence between images and a 3D surface model by asking the annotators to first segment the image into semantic regions and then localize each of the sampled points on any of the rendered part images. The surface coordinates of the rendered views are used to localize the collected 2D points on the 3D model.
