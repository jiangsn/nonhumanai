Figure 1: Dense pose estimation aims at mapping all human pixels of an RGB image to the 3D surface of the human body. We introduce DensePose-COCO, a large-scale ground-truth dataset containing manually annotated image-to-surface correspondences for 50K images, and train DensePose-rcnn to densely regress UV coordinates at multiple frames per second. Left: The image and the regressed correspondence by DensePose-RCNN. Middle: DensePose-COCO dataset annotations. Right: Partitioning and UV parametrization of the body surface.
