Figure 1. Given a text query and a sequence of video frames, the proposed model outputs prediction sequences for all object instances in the video prior to determining the referred instance. Here predictions with the same color and shape belong to the same sequence and attend to the same object instance in different frames. Note that the order of instance predictions for different frames remains the same. Best viewed in color.
