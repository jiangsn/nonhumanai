Figure 5. Qualitative visualization of results. The top row shows a qualitative result from the COVER dataset. The copy-moved bag confuses the RGB Net, and the noise net. RGB-N achieves a better detection in this case because it combines the features from the two streams. The middle row shows a qualitative result from the columbia. The RGB net produces a more accurate result than noise stream. Taking into account both streams produces a better result for RGB-n. The bottom row shows a qualitative result from the casial.0. The spliced object leaves clear tampering artifacts in both the RGB and noise streams, which yields precise detections for the RGB, noise, and RGB-N networks.
