Table 1. AP comparison on our synthetic COCO dataset. The row is the model architectures, where RGB net is a single faster R-CNN using RGB image as input; noise net is a single faster R-CNN using noise feature map as input; RGB-N noise RPN is a two-stream faster R-CNN using noise features for RPN network. Noise + RGB RPN is a two-stream faster R-CNN using both noise and RGB features as the input of RPN network. RGB-N is a two-stream faster R-CNN using RGB features for RPN network
