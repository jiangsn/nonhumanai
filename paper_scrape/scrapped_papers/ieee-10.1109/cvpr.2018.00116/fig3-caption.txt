Figure 3. Illustration of tampering artifacts. Two examples showing tampering artifacts in the original RGB image and in the local noise features obtained by the SRM filter layer. The second column is the amplified regions for the red bounding boxes in the first column. As shown in the second column, the unnaturally high contrast along the baseball player's edges provides a strong cue about the presence of tampering. The third column shows the local noise inconsistency between tampered regions and authentic regions. In different scenarios, visual information and noise features play a complementary role in revealing tampering artifacts.
