Figure 2. Gangealing overview. We first train a generator G on unaligned data. We create a synthetically-generated dataset for alignment by learning a mode c in the generator's latent space. We use this dataset to train a spatial transformer network T to map from unaligned to corresponding aligned images using a perceptual loss [38]. The spatial transformer generalizes to align real images automatically.
