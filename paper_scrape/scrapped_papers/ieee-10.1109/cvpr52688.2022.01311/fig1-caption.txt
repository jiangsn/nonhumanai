Figure 1. Given an input dataset of unaligned images, our gangealing algorithm discovers dense correspondences between all images. Top row: images from lsun cats and the dataset's average image. Second row: our learned transformations of the input images. Third row: dense correspondences learned by gangealing. Bottom row: by annotating the average transformed image, we can propagate user edits to images and videos. Please see our project page for detailed video results: www.wpeebles.com/gangealing.
