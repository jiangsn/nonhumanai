Figure 5. PCK {@}\alpha_{\mathbf{bbox}} on various SPair-71K categories for \alpha_{\mathbf{bbox}} between 10−1 and 10−2. we report the average threshold (maximum distance for a correspondence to be deemed correct) in pixels for 256×256 images beneath each plot. Gangealing outperforms state-of-the-art supervised methods for very precise thresholds (< 2 pixel error tolerance), sometimes by substantial margins.
