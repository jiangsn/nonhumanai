Figure 3. Dense correspondence results on eight datasets. For each dataset, the top row shows unaligned images and the dataset average image. The middle row shows our learned alignment of the input images. The bottom row shows dense correspondences between the images. For our clustering models (lsun horses and cars), we show results for one selected cluster. See supplement f for uncurated results.
