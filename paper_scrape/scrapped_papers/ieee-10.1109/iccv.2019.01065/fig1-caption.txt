Figure 1. Training. The training set consists of images of various object classes (source classes). We train a model to translate images between these source object classes. Deployment. We show our trained model very few images of the target class, which is sufficient to translate images of source classes to analogous images of the target class even though the model has never seen a single image from the target class during training. Note that the FUNIT generator takes two inputs: 1) a content image and 2) a set of target class images. It aims to generate a translation of the input image that resembles images of the target class.
