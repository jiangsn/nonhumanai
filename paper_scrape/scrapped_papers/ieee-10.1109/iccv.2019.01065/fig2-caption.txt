Figure 2. Visualization of the few-shot unsupervised image-to-image translation results. The results are computed using the FUNIT-5 model. From top to bottom, we have the results from the animal face, bird, flower, and food datasets. We train one model for each dataset. For each example, we visualize 2 out of 5 randomly sampled class images y1y2, the input content image x, and the translation output x¯¯¯. The results show that FUNIT generate plausible translation outputs under the difficult few-shot setting where the models see no images from any of the target classes during training. We note that the objects in the output images have similar poses to the inputs.
