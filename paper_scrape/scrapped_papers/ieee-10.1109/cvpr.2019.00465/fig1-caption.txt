Figure 1. 
Our model predicts dense depth when both an ordinary camera and people in the scene are freely moving (right). We train our model on our new MannequinChallenge datasetâ€”a collection of Internet videos of people imitating mannequins, i.e., freezing in diverse, natural poses, while a camera tours the scene (left). Because people are stationary, geometric constraints hold; this allows us to use multi-view stereo to estimate depth which serves as supervision during training.2
