Figure 5. 
Quantitative comparison. We compare ReStyle with current state-of-the-art optimization-based and encoder-based methods by analyzing reconstruction via three evaluation metrics — ID similarity for faces, L2 loss for cars, and LPIPS loss for churches — while measuring each method’s inference time. Each encoder-based method is represented using a ⋆ symbol. The corresponding hybrid method is marked using a dashed line of the same color with the ReStyle applied over the base method shown using a solid line of the same color. Optimization results are shown using a dashed green line. Methods based on pSp are shown in red with methods based on e4e shown in blue. Finally, results obtained using IDInvert [50] are shown in orange. Note that both axes are shown in log-scale.
