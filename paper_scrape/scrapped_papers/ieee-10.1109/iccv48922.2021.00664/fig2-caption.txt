Our ReStyle iterative inversion scheme. Given an input image x, the scheme is initialized with the average latent code w0 and its corresponding image yˆ0. Consider step t. ReStyle operates on an extended input obtained by concatenating x with the image yˆt corresponding to the current inversion prediction wt∈W+ (shown in yellow). The encoder E is then tasked with predicting a residual latent code, Δt∈W+ (shown in blue). The predicted residual is then added to the previous latent code wt to obtain the updated latent code prediction wt+1 (shown in green). Finally, passing the newly computed latent code to the generator G results in an updated reconstruction yˆt+1, which is then passed as input in the following step. During training, the loss objectives are computed at each forward pass with back-propagation performed accordingly. A similar multi-step process is performed during inference.
