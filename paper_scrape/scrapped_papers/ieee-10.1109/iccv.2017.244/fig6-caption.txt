Figure 6: Different variants of our method for mapping labelsâ†”photos trained on cityscapes. From left to right: Input, cycle-consistency loss alone, adversarial loss alone, GAN + forward cycle-consistency loss (F(G(x))\approx x), GAN + backward cycle-consistency loss (G(F(y))\approx y), cyclegan (our full method), and ground truth. Both cycle alone and GAN + backward fail to produce images similar to the target domain. GAN alone and GAN + forward suffer from mode collapse, producing identical label maps regardless of the input photo.
