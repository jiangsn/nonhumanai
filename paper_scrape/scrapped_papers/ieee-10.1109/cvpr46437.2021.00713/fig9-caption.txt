Figure 9: 
Epipolar plane images (EPI) synthesized from videos rendered by different models for the Brandenburg Gate scene. The camera is translated from left to right along a straight path, and the horizontal line at the same position (red line, reference) is taken across all video frames and stacked vertically, producing the EPIs shown above. A temporally consistent video results in a clean and smooth EPI, while noise in an EPI indicates temporal flickering artifacts. NRWâ€™s video contains heavy flickering with transient objects popping in and out of the frame while NeRF produces severe ghosting artifacts in front of the landmarks. NeRF-W produces highly temporally consistent videos. We strongly encourage the readers to watch the video in the supplementary material.
