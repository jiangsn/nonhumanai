Fig. 6: Examples of generated tracks with different behaviour controlled via the auxiliary input. With a high auxiliary input (λAi>0), the generator agent creates a track where the solver easily can get to the waypoints (left figure). With a low auxiliary value (λAi<0), it is conditioned for reward for increases air-time causing the generator to create a highly undulated track (right figure).
