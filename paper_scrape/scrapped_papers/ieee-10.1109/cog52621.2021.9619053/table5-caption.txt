Table V: Comparison of performance on a set of previously unseen validation tracks (1000 x 20 runs). Platform game values indicate success rate, fraction of tracks completed by at least one agent, and average steps taken to reach the goal. Racing game values indicate success rate, fraction of track completed, and average distance completed. Fixed track is trained on a fixed set of tracks, rule pcg is trained on rule based pcg generated from a set of rules randomized to create different track every time, and fixed aux. Is trained on a generator with a constant auxiliary input.
