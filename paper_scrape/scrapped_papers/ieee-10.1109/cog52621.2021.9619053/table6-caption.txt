Table VI: Racing game: solvers (trained on fixed track, rule pcg, and arlpcg environments respectively) average success ratio and speed on generator generated tracks. Aver-aged over 100000 trials (250 trials on 50 tracks each 500 m long). The generator's auxiliary input is varied between [-1,1] to moderate the difficulty of the track. The success ratio and average speed reflects the difficulty even for the agents that were not trained using the generator.
