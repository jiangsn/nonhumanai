Table VII: Platform game: solvers (trained on fixed track, rule pcg, and arlpcg environments respectively) average success ratio on generator generated tracks. Averaged over 50000 trials (50 tracks รก 1000 trials). The generator's auxiliary input is varied between [-1,1] to moderate the diffi-culty of the track.
