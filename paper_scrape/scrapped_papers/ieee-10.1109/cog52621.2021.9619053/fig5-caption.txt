Fig. 5: Examples of generated tracks with different auxiliary inputs to the generator. With a high auxiliary input (λAi>0), the generator agent creates a track that is easy for the solver to follow when trying to reach the waypoints (left figure). With a low auxiliary value (λAi<0), it tries to make the solver fail by creating a track that has long and difficult jumps (right figure).
