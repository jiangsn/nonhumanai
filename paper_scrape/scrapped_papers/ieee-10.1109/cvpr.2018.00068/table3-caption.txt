Table 3: Our dataset breakdown. We split our 2AFC dataset in to three main portions (1,2) training and test sets with our distortions. Our training and test sets contain patches sampled from the MIT5K [7] and RAISE 1k [10] datasets, respectively (3) a test set containing real algorithm outputs, containing patches from a variety of applications. Our JND data is on traditional and CNN-based distortions
