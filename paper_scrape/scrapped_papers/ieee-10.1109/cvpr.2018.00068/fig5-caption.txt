Figure 5: Correlating perceptual tests. We show performance across methods, including unsupervised [26], self-supervised [1], [43], [12], [56], [62], [41], [42], [40], [13], [63], supervised [27], [51], [20], and our perceptually-learned metrics (LPIPS). The scores are on our 2AFC and JND tests, averaged across traditional and CNN-based distortions.
