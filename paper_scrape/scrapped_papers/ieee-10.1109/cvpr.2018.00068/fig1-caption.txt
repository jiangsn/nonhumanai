Figure 1: Which patch (left or right) is “closer” to the middle patch in these examples? in each case, the traditional metrics (L2/PSNR, SSIM, FSIM) disagree with human judgments. But deep networks, even across architectures (squeezenet [20], AlexNet [27], VGG [51]) and supervision type (supervised [46], self-supervised [13], [40], [42], [63], and even unsupervised [26]), provide an emergent embedding which agrees surprisingly well with humans. We further calibrate existing deep embeddings on a large-scale database of perceptual judgments; models and data can be found at https://www.github.com/richzhang/perceptualsimilarity.
