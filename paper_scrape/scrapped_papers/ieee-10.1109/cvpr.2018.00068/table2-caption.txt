Table 2: Our distortions. Our traditional distortions (left) are performed by basic low-level image editing operations. We also sequentially compose them to better explore the space. Our CNN-based distortions (right) are formed by randomly varying parameters such as task, network architecture, and learning parameters. The goal of the distortions is to mimic plausible distortions seen in real algorithm outputs
