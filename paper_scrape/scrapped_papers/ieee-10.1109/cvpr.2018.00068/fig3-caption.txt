Figure 3: Computing distance from a network (Left) To compute a distance do between two patches, x, x0, given a network F, we first compute deep embeddings, normalize the activations in the channel dimension, scale each channel by vector w, and take the ℓ2 distance. We then average across spatial dimension and across all layers. (Right) A small network G is trained to predict perceptual judgment h from distance pair (d0, d1).
