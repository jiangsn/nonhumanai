Figure 2. HoloGAN's generator network: We employ 3D convolutions, 3D rigid-body transformations, the projection unit and 2D convolutions. We also remove the traditional input layer from z, and start from a learnt constant 4D tensor. The latent vector z is instead fed through MLPs to map to the affine transformation parameters for adaptive instance normalisation (AdaIN). Inputs are coloured gray. Best viewed in colour.
