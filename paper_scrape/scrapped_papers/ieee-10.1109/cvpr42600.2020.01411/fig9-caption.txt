Figure 9: Two sets of real images were picked to form the source set and the destination set. The rest of the images were generated by copying specified subset of styles from the source set into the destination set. This experiment repeats the one from [24], but with real images. Copying the coarse styles brings high-level aspects such as pose, general hair style, and face shape from source set, while all colors (eyes, hair, lighting) and finer facial features resemble the destination set. Instead, if we copy middle styles from the source set, we inherit smaller scale facial features like hair style, eyes open/closed from source, while the pose, and general face shape from destination are preserved. Finally, copying the fine styles from the source set brings mainly the color scheme and microstructure.
