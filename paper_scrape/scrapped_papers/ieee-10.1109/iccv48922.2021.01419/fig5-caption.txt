FID over time. Left: FID-20 over time for 50 frames generated by each method. Right: FID-50 over 500 frames generated by our method via autopilot. For comparison, we plot FID-50 for the baselines on the first 50 steps. Despite generating sequences an order of magnitude longer, our FID-50 is still lower than that of the baselines. See Sec. 6.1, 6.3.
