Figure 2: Greatest hits: Volume 1 dataset. What do these materials sound like when they are struck? we collected 977 videos in which people explore a scene by hitting and scratching materials with a drumstick, comprising 46,577 total actions. Human annotators labeled the actions with material category labels, the location of impact, an action type label (hit vs. Scratch), and a reaction label (shown on right). These labels were used only for analyzing what our sound prediction model learned, not for training it. We show images from a selection of videos from our dataset for a subset of the material categories (here we show examples where it is easy to see the material in question).
