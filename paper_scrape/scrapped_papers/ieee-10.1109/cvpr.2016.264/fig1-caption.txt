Figure 1: We train a model to synthesize plausible impact sounds from silent videos, a task that requires implicit knowledge of material properties and physical interactions. In each video, someone probes the scene with a drumstick, hitting and scratching different objects. We show frames from two videos and below them the predicted audio tracks. The locations of these sampled frames are indicated by the dotted lines on the audio track. The predicted audio tracks show seven seconds of sound, corresponding to multiple hits in the videos.
