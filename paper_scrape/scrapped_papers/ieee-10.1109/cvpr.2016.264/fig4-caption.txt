Figure 4: We train a neural network to map video sequences to sound features. These sound features are subsequently converted into a waveform using either parametric or example-based synthesis. We represent the images using a convolutional network, and the time series using a recurrent neural network. We show a subsequence of images corresponding to one impact.
