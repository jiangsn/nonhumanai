Figure 3: (a) Cochleagrams for selected classes. We extracted audio centered on each impact sound in the dataset, computed our subband-envelope representation, and then estimated the mean for each class. (b) Confusion matrix derived by classifying sound features. Rows correspond to confusions made for a single category. The row ordering was determined automatically, by similarity in material confusions (see the supplementary material).
