Fig. 1. With cnn explainer, learners can visually examine how convolutional neural networks (cnns) transform input images into classification predictions (e.g., predicting espresso for an image of a coffee cup), and interactively learn about their underlying mathematical operations. in this example, a learner uses cnn explainer to understand how convolutional layers work through three tightly integrated views, each explaining the convolutional process in increasing levels of detail. (a) the overview visualizes a cnn architecture where each neuron is encoded as a square with a heatmap representing the neuron's output. (b) clicking a neuron reveals how its activations are computed by the previous layer's neurons, displaying the often-overlooked intermediate computation through animations of sliding kernels. (c) convolutional interactive formula view for inspecting underlying mathematics of the dot-product operation core to convolution. for clarity, some annotations are removed and views are re-positioned.
