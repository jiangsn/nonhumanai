Fig. 2. In cnn explainer, tightly integrated views with different levels of abstractions work together to help users more easily learn about the intricate interplay between a cnn's high-level structure and low-level mathematical operations. (a) the overview summarizes connections of all neurons; (b) the elastic view animates the intermediate convolutional computation of the user-selected neuron in the overview; and (c) interactive formula interactively demonstrates the detailed calculation on the selected input in the elastic view.
