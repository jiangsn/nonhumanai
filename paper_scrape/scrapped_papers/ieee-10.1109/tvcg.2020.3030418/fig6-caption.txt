Fig. 6. The interactive formula views explain the underlying mathematical operations of a cnn. (a) shows the element-wise dot-product occurring in a convolutional neuron, (b) visualizes the activation function relu, and (c) illustrates how max pooling works. users can hover over heatmaps to display an operation's input-to-output mapping. (d) interactively explains the softmax function, helping users connect numbers from the formula to their visual representations. users can click the info button to scroll to the corresponding section in the tutorial article, and the play button to start the window sliding animation in (a)-(c).
