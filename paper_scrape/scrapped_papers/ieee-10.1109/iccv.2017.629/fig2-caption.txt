Figure 2. The architecture of the proposed stackgan. The stage-i generator draws a low-resolution image by sketching rough shape and basic colors of the object from the given text and painting the background from a random noise vector. Conditioned on stage-i results, the stage-ii generator corrects defects and adds compelling details into stage-i results, yielding a more realistic high-resolution image.
