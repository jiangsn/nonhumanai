Figure 1. Comparison of the proposed stackgan and a vanilla one-stage GAN for generating 256×256 images. (a) Given text descriptions, stage-i of stackgan sketches rough shapes and basic colors of objects, yielding low-resolution images. (b) Stage-ii of stackgan takes stage-i results and text descriptions as inputs, and generates high-resolution images with photo-realistic details. (c) Results by a vanilla 256×256 GAN which simply adds more upsampling layers to state-of-the-art GAN-INT-CLS [26]. It is unable to generate any plausible images of 256×256 resolution.
