Figure 7. Conditioning augmentation (ca) helps stabilize the training of conditional GAN and improves the diversity of the generated samples. (Row 1) without CA, Stage-I GAN fails to generate plausible 256\times256256×256 samples. Although different noise vector zz is used for each column, the generated samples collapse to be the same for each input text description. (Row 2–3) with CA but fixing the noise vectors z, methods are still able to generate birds with different poses and viewpoints.
