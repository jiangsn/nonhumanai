Figure 1: Given a reference style image (a) And an input image (b), We seek to create an output image of the same scene as the input, but with the style of the reference image. The neural style algorithm [5] (c) Successfully transfers colors, but also introduces distortions that make the output look like a painting, which is undesirable in the context of photo style transfer. In comparison, our result (d) Transfers the color of the reference style image equally well while preserving the photorealism of the output. On the right (e), We show 3 insets of (b), (c), and (d) (in that order). Zoom in to compare results.
