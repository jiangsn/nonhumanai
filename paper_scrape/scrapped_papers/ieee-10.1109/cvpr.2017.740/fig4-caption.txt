Figure 4: Comparison of our method against neural style and CNNMRF. Both neural style and CNNMRF produce strong distortions in their synthesized images. Neural style also entirely ignores the semantic context for style transfer. CNNMRF tends to ignore most of the texture in the reference style image since it uses nearest neighbor search. Our approach is free of distortions and matches texture semantically.
