Figure 3: Transferring the dramatic appearance of the reference style image ((a)-inset), onto an ordinary flat shot in (a) Is challenging. We produce results using our method with different 位 parameters. A too small 位 value cannot prevent distortions, and thus the results have a non-photorealistic look in (b,c). Conversely, a too large 位 value suppresses the style to be transferred yielding a half-transferred look in (e,f). We found the best parameter 位=104 to be the sweet spot to produce our result (d) And all the other results in this paper.
