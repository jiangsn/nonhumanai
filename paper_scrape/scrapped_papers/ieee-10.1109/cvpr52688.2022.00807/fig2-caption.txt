Figure 2. The scene is split into multiple Block-NeRFs that are each trained on data within some radius (dotted orange line) of a specific Block-NeRF origin coordinate (orange dot). To render a target view in the scene, the visibility maps are computed for all of the NeRFs within a given radius. Block-NeRFs with low visibility are discarded (bottom Block-NeRF) and the color output is rendered for the remaining blocks. The renderings are then merged based on each block origin's distance to the target view.
