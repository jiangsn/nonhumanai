Table 2. Comparison of different numbers of Block-NeRFs for reconstructing the mission bay dataset. Splitting the scene into multiple Block-NeRFs improves the reconstruction accuracy, even when holding the total number of weights constant (bottom section). The number of blocks determines the size of the area each block is trained on and the relative compute expense at inference time
