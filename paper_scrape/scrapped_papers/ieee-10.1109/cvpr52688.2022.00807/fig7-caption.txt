Figure 7. Model ablation results on multi segment data. Appearance embeddings help the network avoid adding cloudy geometry to explain away changes in the environment like weather and lighting. Removing exposure slightly decreases the accuracy. The pose optimization helps sharpen the results and removes ghosting from repeated objects, as observed with the telephone pole in the first row.
