Figure 6. Inference speed vs sample quality: comparing LDMs with different amounts of compression on the celeba-hq (left) and imagenet (right) datasets. Different markers indicate \{10, 20, 50, 100, 200\} sampling steps with the ddim sampler, counted from right to left along each line. The dashed line shows the fid scores for 200 steps, indicating the strong performance of LDM-\{4-8\} compared to models with different compression ratios. Fid scores assessed on 5000 samples. All models were trained for 500k (celeba) / 2m (imagenet) steps on an a100.
