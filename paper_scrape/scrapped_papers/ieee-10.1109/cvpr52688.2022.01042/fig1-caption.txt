Figure 1. Boosting the upper bound on achievable quality with less agressive downsampling. Since diffusion models offer excellent inductive biases for spatial data, we do not need the heavy spatial downsampling of related generative models in latent space, but can still greatly reduce the dimensionality of the data via suitable autoencoding models, see sec. 3. Images are from the div2k [1] validation set, evaluated at 5122 px. We denote the spatial down-sampling factor by ff. Reconstruction fids [28] and psnr are calculated on imagenet-val. [12]; see also tab. 8.
