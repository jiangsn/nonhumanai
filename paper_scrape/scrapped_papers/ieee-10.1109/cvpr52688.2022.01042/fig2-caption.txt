Figure 2. Illustrating perceptual and semantic compression: most bits of a digital image correspond to imperceptible details. While dms allow to suppress this semantically meaningless information by minimizing the responsible loss term, gradients (during training) and the neural network backbone (training and inference) still need to be evaluated on all pixels, leading to superfluous computations and unnecessarily expensive optimization and inference. We propose latent diffusion models (ldms) as an effective generative model and a separate mild compression stage that only eliminates imperceptible details. Data and images from [29].
