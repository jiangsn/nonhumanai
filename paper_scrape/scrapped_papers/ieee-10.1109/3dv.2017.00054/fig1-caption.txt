Figure 1 Illustration of our method on the task of predicting geometry from a single color image. From the image our method hierarchically generates a surface with increasing resolution. In order to have sufficient information for the prediction of the higher resolution we predict at each level multiple feature channels which serve as input for the next level and at the same time allow us to generate the output of the current level. We start with a resolution of 163 and divide the voxel side length by two on each level reaching a final resolution of 2563.
