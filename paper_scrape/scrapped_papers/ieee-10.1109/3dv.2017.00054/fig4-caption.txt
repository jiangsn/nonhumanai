Figure 4 2D visualization of the cropping and upsampling module. The cropping module (left) crops out the part of the feature block centered around the child node's octant. The upsampling module (right) then upsamples the feature map using up-convolutional layers to a new feature block with higher spatial resolution. The dashed lines indicate the size of the output blocks and the octants.
