Figure 3: 
IMAGENET-O examples are closer to ImageNet examples than previous out-of-distribution (OOD) detection datasets. For example, ImageNet has triceratops examples and IMAGENET-O has visually similar T-Rex examples, but they are still OOD. Previous OOD detection datasets use OOD examples from wholly different data generating processes. For instance, previous work uses the Describable Textures Dataset [9], Places365 scenes [58], and synthetic blobs to test ImageNet OOD detectors. To our knowledge we propose the first dataset of OOD examples collected for ImageNet models.
