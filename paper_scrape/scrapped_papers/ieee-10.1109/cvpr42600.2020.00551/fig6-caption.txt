Figure 6: Exemplar applications of the proposed method. (a) Demonstration of the semantically multi-modal image synthesis (SMIS) task. (b) Application of our SMIS model in appearance mixture. Our model extracts styles of different semantic classes from different sources and generates a mixed image by combining these semantic styles with the given semantic mask. (c) Application of our SMIS model in semantic manipulation. (d) Application of our SMIS model in image extrapolation. Zoom in for better details.
