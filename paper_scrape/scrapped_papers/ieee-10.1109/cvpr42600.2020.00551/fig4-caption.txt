Figure 4: Qualitative comparison between GroupDNet and other baseline models. The first two rows represent the results of different models by changing their upper-clothes latent code while the last two rows represent their results of changing the pants latent code. Note, for those models which have no class-specific controller such as VSPADE, we alter their overall latent codes to generate different images.
