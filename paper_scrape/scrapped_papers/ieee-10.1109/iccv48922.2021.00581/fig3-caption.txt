Figure 3: 
Visualizations of the recovered 3D model in the observation and canonical frames of reference, with insets showing orthographic views in the forward and left directions. Note the right-to-left and front-to-back displacements between the observation and canonical model, which are modeled by the deformation field for this observation.
