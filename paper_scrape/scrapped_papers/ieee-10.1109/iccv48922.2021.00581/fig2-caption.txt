Figure 2: 
We associate a latent deformation code (ω) and an appearance code (ψ) to each image. We trace the camera rays in the observation frame and transform samples along the ray to the canonical frame using a deformation field encoded as an MLP that is conditioned on the deformation code ω. We query the template NeRF [32] using the transformed sample (x′, y′, z′), viewing direction (θ, ϕ) and appearance code ψ as inputs to the MLP and integrate samples along the ray following NeRF.
