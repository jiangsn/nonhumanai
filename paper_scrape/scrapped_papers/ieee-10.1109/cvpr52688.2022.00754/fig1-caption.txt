Figure 1. We propose a novel DualStyleGAN for exemplar-based high-resolution (1024Ã—1024) portrait style transfer. The artistic portraits of (b)-(d) generated from a real face (a) successfully imitate the color and structural styles of the examples seen in their respective lower-left corners. DualStyleGAN features dual style paths: An intrinsic style path and an extrinsic style path for flexible control over the content and style, respectively. (e) A cartoon face generated from arbitrary intrinsic and extrinsic style codes. Samples generated by (f) varying extrinsic styles with fixed intrinsic styles, (g) varying intrinsic styles with fixed extrinsic styles, and (h) varying both styles.
