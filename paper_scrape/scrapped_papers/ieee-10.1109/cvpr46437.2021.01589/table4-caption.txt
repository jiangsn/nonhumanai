Table 4: 
Benchmarking on the test set of the High Speed Event and RGB camera (HS-ERGB) dataset. We report PSNR and SSIM for all sequences by skipping 5 and 7 frames respectively, and reconstructing the missing frames with each method. By design LEDVDI [15] can interpolate only 5 frames. Uses frames and Uses events indicate if a method uses frames or events respectively. Color indicates whether a method works with color frames. For SSIM and PSNR the scores are averaged over the sequences. Best results are shown in bold and the second best are underlined.
