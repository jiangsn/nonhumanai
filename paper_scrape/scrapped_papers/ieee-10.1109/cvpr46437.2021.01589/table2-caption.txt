Table 2: 
Results on standard video interpolation benchmarks such as Middlebury [2], Vimeo90k (interpolation) [43] and GoPro [19]. In all cases, we use a test subset of the datasets. To compute SSIM and PSNR, we downsample the original video and reconstruct the skipped frames. For Middlebury and Vimeo90k (interpolation), we skip 1 and 3 frames, and for GoPro we skip 7 and 15 frames due its its high frame rate of 240 FPS. Uses frames and Uses events indicate if a method uses frames and events for interpolation. For event-based methods we generate events from the skipped frames using the event simulator [6]. Color indicates if a method works with color frames. For SSIM and PSNR we show mean and one standard deviation. Note, that we can not produce results with 3 skips on the Vimeo90k dataset, since it consists of frame triplet. We show the best result in each column in bold and the second-best using underscore text.
