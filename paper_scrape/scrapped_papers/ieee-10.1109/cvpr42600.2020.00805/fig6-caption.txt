Figure 6. Context-aware color and depth inpainting. Given the color, depth, the extracted and linked depth edges as inputs, we randomly select one of the edges as a subproblem. We start with inpainting the depth edge in the synthesis region (red) using an edge inpainting network. We then concatenate the inpainted depth edges with the context color together and apply a color inpainting network to produce the inpainted color. Similarly, we concatenate the inpainted depth edges with the context depth and apply a depth inpainting network to produce the inpainted depth.
