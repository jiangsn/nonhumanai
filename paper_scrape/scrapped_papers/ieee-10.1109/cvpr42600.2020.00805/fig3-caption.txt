Figure 3. Conceptual illustration of the LDI inpainting algorithm. (a) The initial LDI is fully connected. A depth edge (discontinuity) is marked in gray. (b) We first cut the LDI pixel connections across the depth, forming a foreground silhouette (green) and a background silhouette (red). (c) For the background silhouette we spawn a context region (blue) and a synthesis region (red) of new LDI pixels. (d) The synthesized pixels have been merged into the ldi.
