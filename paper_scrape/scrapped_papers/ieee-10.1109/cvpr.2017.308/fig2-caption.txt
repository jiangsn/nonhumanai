Figure 2. Statistics of the text effects images. (a)(c) Flame and denim fabric text effects. (b)(d) Textures with similar distances to the text skeleton (in white) tend to have similar patterns. (e) Pixels are divided into N=16 classes using different partition modes. (f)-(g) High correlation between pixel colors and distances: Pixels are distinguished from each other by their distances in RGB space. (h)-(i) High correlation between patch scales and distances: Patches with similar distances have uniform responses to changes of their size.
