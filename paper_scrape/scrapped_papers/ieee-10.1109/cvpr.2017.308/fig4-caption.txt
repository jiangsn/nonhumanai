Figure 4. Robust normalized distance estimation. (a) The text image. (b) Our detected text skeleton and the notation definition. (c) The estimated normalized distance. The distance of the pixels on the text boundary to the text skeleton are normalized to 1 (colored by magenta). (d) The statistics of the text width.
