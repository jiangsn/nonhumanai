Fig. 1. (a) Original GAN framework. A generator G
 and a discriminator D
 play a two-player adversarial game. The updating gradients of the generator G
 are received from the adaptive objective, which depends on discriminator D
. (b) Proposed E-GAN framework. A population of generators {GÎ¸}
 evolves in a dynamic environment, the discriminator D
. Each evolutionary step consists of three substages: variation, evaluation, and selection. The best offspring are kept.
