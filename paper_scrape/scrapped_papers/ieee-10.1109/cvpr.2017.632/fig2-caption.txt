Figure 2: Training a conditional GAN to map edgesâ†’photo. The discriminator, D, learns to classify between fake (synthesized by the generator) and real {edge, photo} tuples. The generator, G, learns to fool the discriminator. Unlike an unconditional GAN, both the generator and discriminator observe the input edge map.
