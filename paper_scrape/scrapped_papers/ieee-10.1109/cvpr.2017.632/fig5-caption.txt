Figure 5: Patch size variations. Uncertainty in the output manifests itself differently for different loss functions. Uncertain regions become blurry and desaturated under L1. The 1×1 PixelGAN encourages greater color diversity but has no effect on spatial statistics. The 16×16 PatchGAN creates locally sharp results, but also leads to tiling artifacts beyond the scale it can observe. The 70×70 PatchGAN forces outputs that are sharp, even if incorrect, in both the spatial and spectral (colorfulness) dimensions. The full 286×286 ImageGAN produces results that are visually similar to the 70×70 PatchGAN, but somewhat lower quality according to our FCN-score metric (Table 2).
