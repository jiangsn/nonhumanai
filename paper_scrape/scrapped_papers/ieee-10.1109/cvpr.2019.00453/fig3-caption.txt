Figure 3. 
Two sets of images were generated from their respective latent codes (sources A and B); the rest of the images were generated by copying a specified subset of styles from source B and taking the rest from source A. Copying the styles corresponding to coarse spatial resolutions (42 – 82) brings high-level aspects such as pose, general hair style, face shape, and eyeglasses from source B, while all colors (eyes, hair, lighting) and finer facial features resemble A. If we instead copy the styles of middle resolutions (162 – 322) from B, we inherit smaller scale facial features, hair style, eyes open/closed from B, while the pose, general face shape, and eyeglasses from A are preserved. Finally, copying the fine styles (642 – 10242 ) from B brings mainly the color scheme and microstructure.
