Table 4. 
The effect of a mapping network in FFHQ. The number in method name indicates the depth of the mapping network. We see that FID, separability, and path length all benefit from having a mapping network, and this holds for both style-based and traditional generator architectures. Furthermore, a deeper mapping network generally performs better than a shallow one.
