FIDs in FFHQ for networks trained by enabling the mixing regularization for different percentage of training examples. Here we stress test the trained networks by randomizing 1â€¦ 4 latents and the crossover points between them. Mixing regularization improves the tolerance to these adverse operations significantly. Labels E and F refer to the configurations in Table 1.
