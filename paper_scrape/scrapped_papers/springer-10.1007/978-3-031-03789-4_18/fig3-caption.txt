The architecture of our method. Our proposed method synthesizes painting by placing transparent triangles using Evolution Strategy (ES). After rendering the parameters on a canvas, we calculate the fitness, which measures how well the canvas fits either a target image, or a concept in the form of a text prompt. The fitness, in turn, guides the evolution process to find better parameters.
