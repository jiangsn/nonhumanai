Compare choices of evolution algorithm: Ours (PGPE with ClipUp) vs. basic evolution algorithm (mutation with simulated annealing) [1]. Both settings fit 50 triangles and all choices except for the EA are the same. We show the results of ours and the basic algorithm at the end of 10, 000 iterations, and the result of the basic algorithm after running 56 times more iterations. The details of evolution process until 10, 000 iterations are shown in the bottom half, where the upper group is for ours and the lower group is for the basic algorithm.
