Model-to-image alignment: We seek to find the rotation \(\mathbf {R}\), the translation \(\mathbf {t}\), and the deformation \(\mathbf {\delta u}\) between the 2D image projections and the 3D model, with respect to the projection camera \(\mathbf {P}\). Finding this transformation will simultaneously result in a refined 3D model \( S ^*\) and a coherent model-to-image alignment through an automated process
