We present Calipso, an interactive method for editing images and videos in a physically coherent manner. Our main idea is to realize physics-based manipulations by running a full-physics simulation on proxy geometries given by non-rigidly aligned CAD models. Running these simulations allows us to apply new, unseen forces to move or deform selected objects, change physical parameters such as mass or elasticity, or even add entire new objects that interact with the rest of the underlying scene. In our method, the user makes edits directly in 3D; these edits are processed by the simulation and then transferred to the target 2D content using shape-to-image correspondences in a photo-realistic rendering process. To align the CAD models, we introduce an efficient CAD-to-image alignment procedure that jointly minimizes for rigid and non-rigid alignment while preserving the high-level structure of the input shape. Moreover, the user can choose to exploit image flow to estimate scene motion, producing coherent physical behavior with ambient dynamics. We demonstrate physics-based editing on a wide range of examples producing myriad physical behavior while preserving geometric and visual consistency.
