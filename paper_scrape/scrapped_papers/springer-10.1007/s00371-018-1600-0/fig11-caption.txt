Scene dynamics: With a real behavior as comparison in (a), the user can choose to produce a natural physical behavior in (b) by estimating scene dynamics from image flow velocity, or to output a slower motion in (c) or a slow motion videos in (d) by tuning the velocity. All these images are taken at the same instant (\(t = tc + 1\)). Each cup is aligned individually. Please see the additional material. a Real behavior (real video). b Estimated dynamics. c Slow dynamics. d Slow motion
