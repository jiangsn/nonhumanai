Model-to-image alignment: energy minimization. We express the problem as an energy minimization problem where the solution is the equilibrium between the internal energy of the physical model \(\mathbf {u}\) and the external energy corresponding to object contour fitting \(\mathbf {p}\). The projection constraints are included such that each 3D points \(u_i\) lies on a sightline passing through camera position and 2D contour point \(p_i\)
