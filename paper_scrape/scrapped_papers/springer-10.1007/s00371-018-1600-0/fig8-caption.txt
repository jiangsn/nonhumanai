3D physics-based manipulations of various objects in images and videos. Our method enables automatic alignment and refinement of an input 3D mesh while matching the visual characteristics of the original scene, as shown in the first image of each sequence. The user can interact with objects through a rich range of manipulations, including rigid transforms, geometry and topological changes, elastic deformations, collision, and physical parameter updates such as mass, stiffness, or gravity, and therefore cut the bananas and let them collide with a table, increase the mass of a car bridge and fold it up, create a pyramid of cups and make it fall, bend the Eiffel tower, make the wind blow to wave the cloths, melt a watch in a painting, duplicate the air balloon and deform it and deflate it, stretch an airplane wing, and create an elastic Tower Bridge.
