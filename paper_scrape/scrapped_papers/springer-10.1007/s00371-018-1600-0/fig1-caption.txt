Our method allows a user to interact in a 3D manner with objects in images and videos by producing rigid and deformable transforms, topological changes, and physical attribute editing (e.g., mass, stiffness, gravity). Using an intuitive mesh refinement and 3D/2D alignment approach and estimating dynamics from image flow, our system produces a final composition without cumbersome user input, while preserving visual consistency. Top: editing Daliâ€™s painting by interactively pulling the watch or decreasing its stiffness leading to melting it. Bottom (video): bending a car bridge by pulling it from a side or by progressively increasing its mass
