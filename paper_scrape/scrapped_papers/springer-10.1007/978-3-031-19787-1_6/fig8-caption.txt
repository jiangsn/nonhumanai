Examples of multimodal conditional image synthesis results produced by PoE-GAN trained on the 1024\times 1024 landscape dataset. We show the segmentation/sketch/style inputs on the bottom right of the generated images for the results in the first row. The results in the second row additionally leverage text inputs, which are shown below the corresponding generated images. Please zoom in for details.
