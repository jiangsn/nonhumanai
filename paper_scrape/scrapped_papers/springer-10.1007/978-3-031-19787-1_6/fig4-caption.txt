(a) Global PoE-Net. We sample a latent feature vector z^{0} using product-of-experts (Eq. (4) in Sect. 3.2), which is then processed by an MLP to output a feature vector w. (b) A residual block in our decoder. Local PoE-Net samples a latent feature map z^k using product-of-experts. Here \oplus  denotes concatenation. LG-AdaIN uses w and z^{k} to modulate the feature activations in the residual branch.
