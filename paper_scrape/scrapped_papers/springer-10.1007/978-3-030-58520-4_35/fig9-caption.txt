Ablation study on the loss weight in Eq.Â (4) for the domain-regularized optimization. From top to bottom: original images, reconstructed images, and manipulation results (wearing eyeglasses). For each group of images, the weight \(\lambda _{dom}\) is set to be 0, 2, 40. When \(\lambda _{dom}\) equals to 0, it produces the best reconstructed results but relatively poor manipulation results. When \(\lambda _{dom}\) equals to 40, we get worse reconstruction but more satisfying manipulation.
