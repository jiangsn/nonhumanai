Removing watermarks from StyleGANv2 
[40] LSUN church 
[77] model. (a) Many images generated by this model include transparent watermarks in the center or text on the bottom. (b) Using GAN Dissection 
[7] to zero 30 text-specific units removes middle but not bottom text cleanly. (c) Removing 60 units does not fully remove text, and distorts other aspects of the image. (b) Applying our method to create a rank-1 change erases both middle and bottom text cleanly.
