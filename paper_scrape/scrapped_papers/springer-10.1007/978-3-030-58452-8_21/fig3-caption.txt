The Copy-Paste-Context interface for rewriting a model. (a) Copy: the user uses a brush to select a region containing an interesting object or shape, defining the target value \(V_*\). (b) Paste: The user positions and pastes the copied object into a single target image. This specifies the \(K_* \rightarrow V_*\) pair constraint. (c) Context: To control generalization, the user selects target regions in several images. This establishes the updated direction d for the associative memory. (d) The edit is applied to the model, not a specific image, so newly generated images will always have hats on top of horse heads. (e) The change has generalized to a variety of different types of horses and poses (see more in AppendixÂ A).
