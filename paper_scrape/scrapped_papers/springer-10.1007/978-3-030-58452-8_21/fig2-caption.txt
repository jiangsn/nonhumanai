(a) A generator consists of a sequence of layers; we focus on one particular layer L. (b) The convolutional weights W serve an associative memory, mapping keys k to values v. The keys are single-location input features, and the values are patterns of output features. (c) A key will tend to match semantically similar contexts in different images. Shown are locations of generated images that have features that match a specific k closely. (d) A value renders shapes in a small region. Here the effect of a value v is visualized by rendering features at one location alone, with features at other locations set to zero. Image examples are taken from a StyleGANv2 model trained on LSUN outdoor church scenes.
