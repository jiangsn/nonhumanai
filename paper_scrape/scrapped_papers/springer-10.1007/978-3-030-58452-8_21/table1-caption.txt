Table 1. Editing a StyleGANv2 
[40] FFHQ 
[39] model to produce smiling faces in \(n=10,000\) images. To quantify the efficacy of the change, we show the percentage of smiling faces among the modified images, and we report the LPIPS distance on masked images to quantify undesired changes. For realism, workers make \(n=1,000\) pairwise judgements comparing images from other methods to ours.
