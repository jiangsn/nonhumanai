Adding and replacing objects in three different settings. (a) Replacing domes with an angular peaked spire causes peaked spires to be used throughout the model. (b) Replacing domes with trees can generate images unlike any seen in a training set. (c) Replacing closed lips with an open-mouth smile produces realistic open-mouth smiles. For each case, we show the images generated by an unchanged model, then the edit propagation results, with and without blending. Our method is shown in the last row.
