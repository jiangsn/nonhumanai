Table 2. We edit a StyleGANv2 
[40] LSUN church 
[77] model to replace domes with spires/trees in \(n=10,000\) images. To quantify efficacy, we show the percentage of dome category pixels changed to the target category, determined by a segmenter 
[73]. To quantify undesired changes, we report LPIPS distance between edited and unchanged images, in non-dome regions. For realism, workers make \(n=1,000\) pairwise judgements comparing images from other methods to ours.
