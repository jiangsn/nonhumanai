Rewriting the weights of a generator to change generative rules. Rules can be changed to (a) remove patterns such as watermarks; (b) add objects such as people; or (c) replace definitions such as making trees grow out of towers. Instead of editing individual images, our method edits the generator, so an infinite set of images can be potentially synthesized and manipulated using the altered rules.
