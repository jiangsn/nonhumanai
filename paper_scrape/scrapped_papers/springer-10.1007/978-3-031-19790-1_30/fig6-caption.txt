Video Analogies: Left: an example of video analogies between all pairs of three input videos (red). Each generated video (black) takes the spatio-temporal layout from the input video in its row, and the appearance and dynamics of the input video from its column. Right: an example of sketch-to-video â€“ the generated video (bottom) takes its spatio-temporal layout from the sketch video of morphed MNIST digits (middle) and its appearance and dynamics from the input video of parading soldiers (top). Please find full videos and additional examples in the supplementary material. (Color figure online)
