Generation Runtime. Left: Comparing between our approach (VGPNN), a naïve extension of GPNN [24] from 2D to 3D and HP-VAE-GAN  [25]. We compared the generation time of 13-frames videos with different spatial resolutions (X-axis). All videos have 16:9 aspect ratio (e.g., 144p is 144\,\times \,256 and 1080p is 1080\,\times \,1920 – full-HD). Right: Close-up of our generation run-time (black line in left). Our approach takes seconds/minutes to generate low-res/high-res video outputs. The drop in 480p is the result of decreasing the patch-size in finer-levels of high-res videos. See Sect. 4 for details, and supplementary for implementation details.
