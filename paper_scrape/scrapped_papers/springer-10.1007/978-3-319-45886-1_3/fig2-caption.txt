Close-up of a scene from Sintel, combined with The Scream painting. (a) With temporal constraint (b) Initialized with previous image warped, but without the constraint (c) Initialized randomly. The marked regions show most visible differences. Error images show the contrast-enhanced absolute difference between frame #1 and frame #2 warped back using ground truth optical flow, as used in our evaluation. The effect of the temporal constraint is very clear in the error images and in the corresponding video.
