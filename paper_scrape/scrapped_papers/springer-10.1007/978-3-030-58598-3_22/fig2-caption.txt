Overview of guidance image generation for training. Consider a scene in which a camera(s) with known parameters and positions travels over time t=0,â‹¯,N. At t=0, the scene is textureless and an output image is generated for this viewpoint. The output image is then back-projected to the scene and a guidance image for a subsequent camera position is generated by projecting the partially textured point cloud. Using this guidance image, the generative method can produce an output that is consistent across views and smooth over time. Note that the guidance image can be noisy, misaligned, and have holes, and the generation method should be robust to such inputs.
