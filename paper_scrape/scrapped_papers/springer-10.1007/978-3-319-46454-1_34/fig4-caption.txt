Evaluation on synthetic data. Left: Mean vertex-to-vertex Euclidean error between the estimated and true shape in a canonical pose, when Gaussian noise is added to 2D joints. Dashed and dotted lines represent the error obtained by guessing the mean shape for males and females, respectively. Right: Error between estimated and true shape when considering only a subset of joints during fitting.
