We compare variations of the computed style codes due to variations in the style images for different methods. Note that for a fair comparison, in addition to the original FUNIT baseline 
[27], we create an improved FUNIT method by using our improved design for the content encoder, image decoder, and discriminator, which is termed “Ours w/o COCO”. “Ours” is our full algorithm where we use COCO as a drop-in replacement for the style encoder in the FUNIT framework. In the bottom part of the figure, we plot the variations of the style code due to using different crops of a style image. Specifically, the style code for each style image is first extracted for each method. We then compute the mean of the style codes for each method. The magnitudes of the deviations from the mean style code are then plotted. Note that to calibrate the network weights in different methods, all the style codes are first normalized by the mean extracted from 500 style images for each method. As shown in the figure, “Ours” produces more consistent translation outputs, which is a direct consequence of a more consistent style code extraction mechanism.
