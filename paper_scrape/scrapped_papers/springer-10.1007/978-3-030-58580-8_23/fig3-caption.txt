Illustration of the content loss problem. The images generated by the baseline 
[27] fail to preserve domain invariant appearance information in the content image. The animals’ bodies are sometimes merged with the background (column 3, & 4), scales of the generated body parts are sometimes inconsistent with the input (column 5), and some body parts absent in the content image show up (column 1 & 2). Our proposed method solves this “content loss” problem.
