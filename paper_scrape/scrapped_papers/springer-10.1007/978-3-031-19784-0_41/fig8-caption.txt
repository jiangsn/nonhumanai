Top: We illustrate the effect of our relevancy-based bootstrapping for (a) using “red hat” as the target edit. (b) w/o bootstrapping our edited image suffers from color bleeding. Our alpha-matte is initialized to capture the hat (\(T_\textsf{ROI}\) = “hat”) using the raw relevancy map, which only provides a very rough supervision (c); during training, our method dramatically refines the matting (d). Bottom: We ablate each of our loss terms and the effect of internal learning (“mango” to “golden mango”). See Sect. 4.3.
