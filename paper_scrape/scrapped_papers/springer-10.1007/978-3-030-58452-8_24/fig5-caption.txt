Comparisons on test-set views for scenes from our new synthetic dataset generated with a physically-based renderer. Our method is able to recover fine details in both geometry and appearance, such as Ship’s rigging, Lego’s gear and treads, Microphone’s shiny stand and mesh grille, and Material’s non-Lambertian reflectance. LLFF exhibits banding artifacts on the Microphone stand and Material’s object edges and ghosting artifacts in Ship’s mast and inside the Lego object. SRN produces blurry and distorted renderings in every case. Neural Volumes cannot capture the details on the Microphone’s grille or Lego’s gears, and it completely fails to recover the geometry of Ship’s rigging.
