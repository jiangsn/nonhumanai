Style transfer using different approaches on 1 and a collection of reference style images. (a) [12] using van Gogh’s “Road with Cypress and Star” as reference style image; (b) [12] using van Gogh’s “Starry night”; (c) [12] using the average Gram matrix computed across the collection of Vincent van Gogh’s artworks; (d) [22] trained on the collection of van Gogh’s artworks alternating target style images every SGD mini-batch; (e) our approach trained on the same collection of van Gogh’s artworks. Stylizations (a) and (b) depend significantly on the particular style image, but using a collection of the style images (c), (d) does not produce visually plausible results, due to oversmoothing over the numerous Gram matrices. In contrast, our approach (e) has learned how van Gogh is altering particular content in a specific manner (edges around objects also stylized, cf. bell tower)
