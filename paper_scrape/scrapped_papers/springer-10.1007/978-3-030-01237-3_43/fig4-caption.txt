1st row - results of style transfer for different styles. 2nd row - sketchy content visualization reconstructed from the latent space E(x) using method of [31]. (a) The encoder for Pollock does not preserve much content due to the abstract style; (b) only rough structure of the content is preserved (coarse patches) because of the distinct style of El Greco; (c) latent space highlights surfaces of the same color and that fine object details are ignored, since Gauguin was less interested in details, often painted plain surfaces and used vivid colors; (d) encodes the thick, wide brushstrokes CÃ©zanne used, but preserves a larger palette of colors.
