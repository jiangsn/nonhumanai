Diffuse particles are generated by a fluid particle f. They are uniformly distributed in a cylinder spanned by the volume radius r

V
, the current position x

f
(t) and the position x

f
(t+Î”t) of the fluid particle. The velocities are initialized according to the positions and the fluid velocity v

f
