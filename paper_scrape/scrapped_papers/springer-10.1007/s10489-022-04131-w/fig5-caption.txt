Trajectory comparison between reality and simulation when serving a topspin ball. The difference between the returned landing positions on the table is about 6.2 cm. In this case, the racket is stationary since it is difficult to understand and simulate all the dynamics parameters of a moving racket in simulation. Therefore, the actions of the racket applied in simulation are always the true actions without any noise and time latency. This reality gap is closed in the retraining SectionÂ 4.3
