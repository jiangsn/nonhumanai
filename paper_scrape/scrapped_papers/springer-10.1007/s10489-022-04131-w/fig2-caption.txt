The entire framework for training and testing. Two high-speed cameras were mounted in the corners of the ceiling for detecting the ball at 150 Hz. The goal is returning the ball to the desired target position on the table. In the first stage, the ballâ€™s state s at the hitting time is predicted by [28, 35]. In this work, we focus on the second stage, where an optimal stoke can be learned based on a novel RL algorithm. The upper part is performed in simulation. The RL model is trained within 10,000 episodes. To cross the reality gap, the model is then retrained in reality (see the bottom part)
