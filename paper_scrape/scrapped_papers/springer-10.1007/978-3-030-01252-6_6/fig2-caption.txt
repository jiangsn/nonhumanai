From left to right, top to bottom: Fig. 2(a): image with hole. Fig. 2(b): inpainted result of PatchMatch [2]. Fig. 2(c): inpainted result of Iizuka et al. [10]. Fig. 2(d): Yu et al. [36]. Fig. 2(e) and (f) are using the same network architecture as Sect. 3.2 but using typical convolutional network, Fig. 2(e) uses the pixel value 127.5 to initialize the holes. Fig. 2(f) uses the mean ImageNet pixel value. Fig. 2(g): our partial convolution based results which are agnostic to hole values.
