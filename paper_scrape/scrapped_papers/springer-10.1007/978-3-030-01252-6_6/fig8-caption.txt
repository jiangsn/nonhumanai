User study results. We perform two kinds of experiments: unlimited time and limited time. (a) In the unlimited time setting, we compare our result with the result generated by another method. The rate where our result is preferred is graphed. 50% means two methods are equal. In the first row, the holes are not allowed to touch the image boundary, while in the second row it is allowed. (b) In the limited time setting, we compare all methods to the ground truth. The subject is given some limited time (250 ms, 1000 ms or 4000 ms) to select which image is more realistic. The rate where ground truth is preferred over the other method is reported. The lower the curve, the better.
