Self-supervised view synthesis. From a real RGBD image \((I_0, D_0)\), we synthesize an input \((\tilde{I}_0, \tilde{D}_0)\) to a refinement model by cycle-rendering through a virtual viewpoint. From left to right: input image; input rendered to a virtual “previous” view; virtual view rendered back to the starting viewpoint; final image \((\hat{I}_0, \hat{D}_0)\) refined with refinement network \(\mathcal {F}_\theta \), trained to match the starting image.
