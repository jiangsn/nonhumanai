Table 1. Quantitative comparisons on the ACID test set. “MV?” indicates whether a method requires (posed) multi-view data for training. We report view synthesis results with two different types of ground truth (shown as X/Y): sequences rendered with 3D Photos [71] (left), and real sequences (right). KID and Style are scaled by 10 and \(10^5\) respectively. See Sect. 4.4 for descriptions of baselines.
