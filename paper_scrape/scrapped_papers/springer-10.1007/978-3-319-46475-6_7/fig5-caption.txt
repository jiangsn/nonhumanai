Effect of label propagation. For each frame, the plots show the fraction of image area that is pre-annotated by the time the human annotator reaches that frame. On the left, the frames are arranged in the order they are processed; on the right, the frames are sorted by magnitude of pre-annotated area. Only 333 frames (1.3% of the total) are less than 90% pre-annotated by the time they are reached by the human annotator.
