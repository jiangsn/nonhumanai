Algorithm overview. (a) The input to our video completion method is a color video and a binary mask video that indicates which parts need to be synthesized. (b) We compute forward and backward flow between adjacent frames as well as a set of non-adjacent frames, extract and complete flow edges, and then use the completed edges to guide a piecewise-smooth flow completion (Sect. 3.2). (c) We follow the flow trajectories to compute a set of candidate pixels for each missing pixel. For each candidate, we estimate a confidence score as well as a binary validity indicator (Sect. 3.3). (d) We fuse the candidates in the gradient domain for each missing pixel using a confidence-weighted average. We pick a frame with most missing pixels and fill it with image inpainting (Sect. 3.4). (e) The result will be passed into the next iteration until there is no missing pixel (Sect. 3.5).
