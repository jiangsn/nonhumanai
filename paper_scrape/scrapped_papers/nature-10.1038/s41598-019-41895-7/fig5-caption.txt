ROC Curves for the Five Triads of Participants. The plot shows the overall performance of each triad (blue dots) as well as the performances of the two types of Senders (“Good” versus “Bad”) in each triad (green and red dots). See text for details on the experimental design used to create a “Good” versus “Bad” Sender. The superscript on each dot denotes the triad number. Shaded areas represent the area under the curve (AUC) for each triad’s ROC curve. The dashed line denotes chance performance.
