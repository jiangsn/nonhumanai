Examples of Screens seen by the Receiver and the Senders across Two Rounds. The Receiver sees the three example screens on the left side and the Senders see the screens on the right side. (Top Row) Screens at the beginning of the trial. Note that the Receiver does not see the bottom line with the gap but the Senders do. The Receiver must rely on the Senders to decide whether or not the red block must be rotated to fill the gap and clear the line. (Middle Row) After the Receiver makes a decision in the first round (in this case, “Rotate”), the game state is updated to show the rotated block. (Bottom Row) After the second round, all participants see the results of the Receiver’s action and whether the line was cleared. In this example, the Receiver executed a corrective action to rotate the block again, thereby filling the gap with the bottom part of the block and clearing the line.
