Average Power Spectra of EEG Signals across Subjects during the SSVEP Task. Power values were averaged across one-second epochs and across subjects. The plots show the average power values during the SSVEP task (between dashed lines) and for comparison, the power values three seconds before and after the task. Note that before and after the task, the power values overlap for the two frequencies, whereas during the task, the power of the frequency corresponding to the correct answer is significantly larger.
