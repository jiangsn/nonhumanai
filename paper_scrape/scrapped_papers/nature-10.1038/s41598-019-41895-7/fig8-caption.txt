SSVEP-Based EEG Brain-Computer Interface used by the Senders and the Receiver. Participants conveyed their decisions regarding whether or not to rotate the current block by controlling a cursor (white filled circle) using EEG based steady state visually evoked potentials (SSVEPs). Participants focused on a flashing LED to the left of the screen (depicted as a circle attached to the screen in Fig. 1) to move the cursor leftwards towards the “Yes” side. Focusing on the LED to the right of the screen (flashing at a different frequency) caused the cursor to move rightwards towards the “No” side. If the cursor reached the green “Yes” bar, the interface interpreted the participant’s decision to be rotation of the block (by 180 degrees). If the cursor reached the “No” bar, the interface took the participant’s decision to be to keep the block’s current orientation.
