Quantification of Learning of Sender’s Reliability by Receiver. (Left Panel) Evolution over time of linear regression weights (Beta) for the Receivers’ decision vector and decision vector for each type of Sender for each 4-trial block (see text for details). (Right Panel) Evolution over time of Pearson Correlation Coefficient between the decisions of Receivers and Senders of each type. Both plots exhibit ascending trends for the “Good” Sender but not the “Bad” Sender, suggesting that Receivers learned which Sender was more reliable during the course of their brain-to-brain interactions with the two Senders.
