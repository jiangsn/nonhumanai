Architecture of BrainNet. Two participants (“Sender 1” and “Sender 2”) each use a Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) based on EEG to convey information about a collaborative task (here, a Tetris-like game) directly to the brain of the third participant (“Receiver”). Information from each Sender is transmitted over the internet to the Receiver’s brain via a Computer-Brain Interface (CBI) based on TMS. After consciously processing the two inputs from the Senders, the Receiver uses a BCI based on EEG to execute an action in the task. The Senders see the result of this action on their screens (the same updated game state is shown on both screens, as indicated by the red arrow from one Sender’s screen to the other). The Senders then have another opportunity to convey to the Receiver’s brain new information to potentially rectify an incorrect choice in the first round. While our experiment only used two rounds, BrainNet allows an arbitrary number of interactions between the Senders and the Receiver as they collaborate to solve a task. BrainNet differs from a previous interface called “Brainet”12 which combines recordings from multiple monkey brains to perform a common motor task but is unidirectional and does not use stimulation to communicate information back to any of the brains.
