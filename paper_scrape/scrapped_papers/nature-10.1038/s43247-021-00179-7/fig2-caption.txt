a MPM simulations of a gravity-dominated fall of an iceberg (GF, top), buoyancy-dominated fall (BF, middle), and capsizing (CS, bottom) calving mechanisms. The color represents the velocity of water particles (blue = 0 m/s; red = 0.6 m/s). Movies of these three simulations can be found in the Supplement (Supplementary Movie 1). b (top) Amplitude of the first generated wave normalized by the maximum wave amplitude as a function of time. The inset shows the modeled maximum wave amplitude against the observed one from the laboratory experiments of Heller et al.13, including error bars corresponding to uncertainties in the 2D/3D transformation (see Methods). Time was shifted so that the time corresponding to the maximum wave height corresponds to t = 0 s in all simulations and experiments. (Bottom) Position of the first generated wave as a function of time. The theoretical prediction for linear shallow-water waves is given by {x}_{\rm{th}}=\sqrt{g{D}_{w}}t.
