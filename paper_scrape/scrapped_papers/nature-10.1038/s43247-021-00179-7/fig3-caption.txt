a MPM simulations of glacier calving for Hi = 200 m and D/Hi = 0.2. A movie of this simulation can be found in the Supplement (Supplementary Movie 2). b Iceberg length to height ratio Li/Hi as a function of the submergence depth to ice height ratio D/Hi. The analytical expression is given by Eq. (1). The water is colored by velocity: blue and red indicate water moving at 0 m/s and 20 m/s, respectively. The gray color in the glacier represents failed particles.
