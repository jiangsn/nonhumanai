a We simulate a wide glacier to focus on the 3D ice fracture characteristics. The ice cliff height is 150 m, the water depth is 200 m. The width of the system is 2 km, the glacier length is 1 km and the length of the water tank is 625 m. This simulation is composed of 36 million particles. A movie of this simulation can be found in the Supplement (Supplementary Movie 5). b Here, a long water tank is used to focus on the 3D tsunami propagation. The ice cliff height is 200 m and the water depth in the main fjord is 125 m. The width of the system is 400 m and the water tank is 1.6 km long. This simulation is composed of 20 million particles. A movie of this simulation can be found in the Supplement (Supplementary Movie 6).
