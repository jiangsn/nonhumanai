The water is colored by velocity: blue and red indicate water moving at 0 m/s and 20 m/s, respectively. The blue color in the glacier represents particles for which the yield criterion was met (plastic deformation). The ice cliff height is ~200 m and the water depth in the main fjord is ~125 m. Movies of this simulation can be found in the Supplement (Supplementary Movies 3 and 4).
