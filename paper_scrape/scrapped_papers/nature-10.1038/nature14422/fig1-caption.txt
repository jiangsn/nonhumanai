a, Most animals can find a compensatory behaviour after an injury. Without relying on predefined compensatory behaviours, they learn how to avoid behaviours that are painful or no longer effective.

RGB-D stands for red, green, blue, depth. c, One type of damage the hexapod may have to cope with (broken leg). d, After damage occurs, in this case making the robot unable to walk fast and in a straight line, damage recovery via IT&E begins. The robot tests different types of behaviours from an automatically generated map of the behaviourâ€“performance space. After each test, the robot updates its predictions of which behaviours will perform well despite the damage. In this way, the robot rapidly discovers an effective compensatory behaviour.
