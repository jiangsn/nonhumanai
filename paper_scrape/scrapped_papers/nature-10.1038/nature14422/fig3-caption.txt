a, Conditions tested on the physical hexapod robot. C1, The undamaged robot. C2, One leg is shortened by half. C3, One leg is unpowered. C4, One leg is missing. C5, Two legs are missing. C6, An imperfect, makeshift repair to the tip of one leg (by a human operator). b, Performance after adaptation. Box plots represent IT&E. The central circle is the median, the edges of the box are the 25th and 75th percentiles, the whiskers extend to the most extreme data points that are not considered outliers, and outliers are plotted individually. Yellow stars represent the performance of the handmade reference tripod gait (Supplementary Methods). Conditions C1–C6 are tested five times each for eight independently created behaviour–performance maps with the ‘duty factor’ behaviour description (that is, 40 experiments per damage condition, Supplementary Methods). Damage conditions C1 and C3 are also tested five times each for eight independently created behaviour–performance maps with the ‘body orientation’ behaviour description (Supplementary Methods). c, Time and number of trials required to adapt. Box plots represent IT&E. d, Robotic arm experiment. The eight-jointed, planar robot arm has to drop a ball into a bin. e, Example conditions tested on the physical robotic arm. C1, One joint is stuck at 45 degrees. C2, One joint has a permanent 45° offset. C3, One broken and one offset joint. Each of these damage conditions was replicated with 15 independent maps. A total of 14 conditions were tested (Extended Data Fig. 7). f, Time and number of trials required to reach within 5 cm of the bin centre. Each condition is tested with 15 independently created behaviour–performance maps.
