This map stores high-performing behaviours at each point in a six-dimensional behaviour space. Each dimension is the portion of time that each leg is in contact with the ground. The behavioural space is discretized at five values for each dimension (0; 0.25; 0.5; 0.75 and 1). Each coloured pixel represents the highest-performing behaviour discovered during map creation at that point in the behaviour space. The matrices visualize the six-dimensional behavioural space in two dimensions according to the legend at the top left. The behaviourâ€“performance map is created with a simulated robot (bottom left) in the Open Dynamics Engine physics simulator (http://www.ode.org). The left matrix is a pre-adaptation map produced by the map creation algorithm. During adaptation, the map is updated as tests are conducted (in this case, for the damage condition where the robot is missing one leg: C4 in Fig. 3a). The right matrix shows the state of the map after a compensatory behaviour is discovered. The arrows and white circles represent the order in which behaviours were tested on the physical robot. The red circle is the final, discovered, compensatory behaviour. Among other areas, high-performing behaviours can be found for the damaged robot in the first two columns of the third dimension. These columns represent behaviours that use the central-left leg least, which is the leg that is missing.
