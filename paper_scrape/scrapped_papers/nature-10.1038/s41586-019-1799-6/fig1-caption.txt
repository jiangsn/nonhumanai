Datasets representative of the UK and US breast cancer screening populations were curated from three screening centres in the UK and one centre in the USA. Outcomes were derived from the biopsy record and longitudinal follow-up. An AI system was trained to identify the presence of breast cancer from a set of screening mammograms, and was evaluated in three primary ways: first, AI predictions were compared with the historical decisions made in clinical practice; second, to evaluate the generalizability across populations, a version of the AI system was developed using only the UK data and retested on the US data; and finally, the performance of the AI system was compared to that of six independent radiologists using a subset of the US testÂ set.
