a, Six readers rated each case (n = 465) using the six-point BI-RADS scale. A fitted ROC curve for each of the readers is compared to the ROC curve of the AI system (see Methods section ‘Statistical analysis’). For reference, a non-parametric ROC curve is presented in tandem. Cases were considered positive (n = 113) if they received a pathology-confirmed diagnosis of cancer within 27 months of the time of screening. Note that this sample of cases was enriched for patients who received a negative biopsy result (n = 119), making this a more-challenging population for screening. The mean reader AUC was 0.625 (s.d. 0.032), whereas the AUC for the AI system was 0.740 (95% CI 0.696, 0.794). The AI system exceeded human performance by a significant margin (ΔAUC = +0.115, 95% CI 0.055, 0.175; P = 0.0002 by two-sided ORH method (see Methods section ‘Statistical analysis’)). For results using a 12-month interval, see Extended Data Fig. 2. b, Pooled results from all six readers from a. c, Pooled results (n = 408) from all 6 readers using a 12-month interval for cancer definition. Cases were considered positive (n = 56) if they received a pathology-confirmed cancer diagnosis within one year (Extended Data Table 3).
