The green and blue dots are two-dimensional (2-D) projections of cell data points on the planes containing only two of the biophysical features. The cell diameter along the rainbow (Diameter-RB) is used as a size indicator. The cell protein concentration corresponds to the mean refractive index difference of the cell (Refractive index feature in Table 1). The attenuation is a feature describing the optical intensity loss caused by cell absorption (Absorption-1 feature in Table 1). Comparison of 3-D and 2-D scatter plots reveals that additional biophysical features serve to classify the cell types more accurately.
