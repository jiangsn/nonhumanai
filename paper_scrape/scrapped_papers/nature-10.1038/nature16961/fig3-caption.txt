a, Each simulation traverses the tree by selecting the edge with maximum action value Q, plus a bonus u(P) that depends on a stored prior probability P for that edge. b, The leaf node may be expanded; the new node is processed once by the policy network pσ and the output probabilities are stored as prior probabilities P for each action. c, At the end of a simulation, the leaf node is evaluated in two ways: using the value network vθ; and by running a rollout to the end of the game with the fast rollout policy pπ, then computing the winner with function r. d, Action values Q are updated to track the mean value of all evaluations r(·) and vθ(·) in the subtree below that action.
