a, Plot showing the playing strength of policy networks as a function of their training accuracy. Policy networks with 128, 192, 256 and 384 convolutional filters per layer were evaluated periodically during training; the plot shows the winning rate of AlphaGo using that policy network against the match version of AlphaGo. b, Comparison of evaluation accuracy between the value network and rollouts with different policies. Positions and outcomes were sampled from human expert games. Each position was evaluated by a single forward pass of the value network vθ, or by the mean outcome of 100 rollouts, played out using either uniform random rollouts, the fast rollout policy pπ, the SL policy network pσ or the RL policy network pρ. The mean squared error between the predicted value and the actual game outcome is plotted against the stage of the game (how many moves had been played in the given position).
