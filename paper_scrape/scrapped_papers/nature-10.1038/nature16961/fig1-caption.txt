a, A fast rollout policy pπ and supervised learning (SL) policy network pσ are trained to predict human expert moves in a data set of positions. A reinforcement learning (RL) policy network pρ is initialized to the SL policy network, and is then improved by policy gradient learning to maximize the outcome (that is, winning more games) against previous versions of the policy network. A new data set is generated by playing games of self-play with the RL policy network. Finally, a value network vθ is trained by regression to predict the expected outcome (that is, whether the current player wins) in positions from the self-play data set. b, Schematic representation of the neural network architecture used in AlphaGo. The policy network takes a representation of the board position s as its input, passes it through many convolutional layers with parameters σ (SL policy network) or ρ (RL policy network), and outputs a probability distribution  or  over legal moves a, represented by a probability map over the board. The value network similarly uses many convolutional layers with parameters θ, but outputs a scalar value vθ(s′) that predicts the expected outcome in position s′.
