a, Results of a tournament between different Go programs (see Extended Data Tables 6,7,8,9,10,11). Each program used approximately 5 s computation time per move. To provide a greater challenge to AlphaGo, some programs (pale upper bars) were given four handicap stones (that is, free moves at the start of every game) against all opponents. Programs were evaluated on an Elo scale37: a 230 point gap corresponds to a 79% probability of winning, which roughly corresponds to one amateur dan rank advantage on KGS38; an approximate correspondence to human ranks is also shown, horizontal lines show KGS ranks achieved online by that program. Games against the human European champion Fan Hui were also included; these games used longer time controls. 95% confidence intervals are shown. b, Performance of AlphaGo, on a single machine, for different combinations of components. The version solely using the policy network does not perform any search. c, Scalability study of MCTS in AlphaGo with search threads and GPUs, using asynchronous search (light blue) or distributed search (dark blue), for 2 s per move.
