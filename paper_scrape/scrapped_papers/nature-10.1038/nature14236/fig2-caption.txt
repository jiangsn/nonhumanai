a, Each point is the average score achieved per episode after the agent is run with ε-greedy policy (ε = 0.05) for 520 k frames on Space Invaders. b, Average score achieved per episode for Seaquest. c, Average predicted action-value on a held-out set of states on Space Invaders. Each point on the curve is the average of the action-value Q computed over the held-out set of states. Note that Q-values are scaled due to clipping of rewards (see Methods). d, Average predicted action-value on Seaquest. See Supplementary Discussion for details.
