The plot was generated by letting the DQN agent play for 2Â h of real game time and running the t-SNE algorithm25 on the last hidden layer representations assigned by DQN to each experienced game state. The points are coloured according to the state values (V, maximum expected reward of a state) predicted by DQN for the corresponding game states (ranging from dark red (highest V) to dark blue (lowest V)). The screenshots corresponding to a selected number of points are shown. The DQN agent predicts high state values for both full (top right screenshots) and nearly complete screens (bottom left screenshots) because it has learned that completing a screen leads to a new screen full of enemy ships. Partially completed screens (bottom screenshots) are assigned lower state values because less immediate reward is available. The screens shown on the bottom right and top left and middle are less perceptually similar than the other examples but are still mapped to nearby representations and similar values because the orange bunkers do not carry great significance near the end of a level.
