The details of the architecture are explained in the Methods. The input to the neural network consists of an 84 × 84 × 4 image produced by the preprocessing map , followed by three convolutional layers (note: snaking blue line symbolizes sliding of each filter across input image) and two fully connected layers with a single output for each valid action. Each hidden layer is followed by a rectifier nonlinearity (that is, ).
