a, Training Elo scores of agents in the league during the 44 days of training. Each point represents a pastÂ player, evaluated against the entire league and the elite built-in bot (whose Elo is set to 0). b, Proportion of validation agents that beat the main agents in more than 80 out of 160 games. This value increased steadily over time, which shows the robustness of league training to unseen strategies. c, The Nash distribution (mixture of the least exploitable players) of the players in the league, as training progressed. It puts the most weight on recent players, suggesting that the latest strategies largely dominate earlier ones, without much forgetting or cycling. For example, player 40 was part of the Nash distribution from its creation at day 20 until 5 days later, when it was completely dominated by newer agents. d, Average number of each unit built by the Protoss agents over the course of league training, normalized by the most common unit. Unlike the main agents, the exploiters rapidly explore different unit compositions. Worker units have been removed for clarity.
