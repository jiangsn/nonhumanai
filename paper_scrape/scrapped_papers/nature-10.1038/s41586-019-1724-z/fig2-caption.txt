a, On Battle.net, StarCraft II players are divided into seven leagues, from Bronze to Grandmaster, according to their ratings (MMR). We played three variants of AlphaStar on Battle.net: AlphaStar Supervised, AlphaStar Mid, and AlphaStar Final. The supervised agent was rated in the top 16% of human players, the midpoint agent within the top 0.5%, and the final agent, on average, within the top 0.15%, achieving a Grandmaster level rating for all three races. b, MMR ratings of AlphaStar Final per race (from top to bottom: Protoss, Terran, Zerg) versus opponents encountered on Battle.net (from left to right: all races combined, Protoss, Terran, Zerg). Note that per-race data are limited; AlphaStar won all Protoss versus Terran games. c, Distribution of effective actions per minute (EPM) as reported by StarCraft II for both AlphaStar Final (blue) and human players (red).
