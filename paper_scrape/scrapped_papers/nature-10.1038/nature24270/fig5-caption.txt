a, Five human joseki (common corner sequences) discovered during AlphaGo Zero training. The associated timestamps indicate the first time each sequence occurred (taking account of rotation and reflection) during self-play training. Extended Data Figure 2 provides the frequency of occurence over training for each sequence. b, Five joseki favoured at different stages of self-play training. Each displayed corner sequence was played with the greatest frequency, among all corner sequences, during an iteration of self-play training. The timestamp of that iteration is indicated on the timeline. At 10 h a weak corner move was preferred. At 47 h the 3–3 invasion was most frequently played. This joseki is also common in human professional play; however AlphaGo Zero later discovered and preferred a new variation. Extended Data Figure 3 provides the frequency of occurence over time for all five sequences and the new variation. c, The first 80 moves of three self-play games that were played at different stages of training, using 1,600 simulations (around 0.4 s) per search. At 3 h, the game focuses greedily on capturing stones, much like a human beginner. At 19 h, the game exhibits the fundamentals of life-and-death, influence and territory. At 70 h, the game is remarkably balanced, involving multiple battles and a complicated ko fight, eventually resolving into a half-point win for white. See Supplementary Information for the full games.
