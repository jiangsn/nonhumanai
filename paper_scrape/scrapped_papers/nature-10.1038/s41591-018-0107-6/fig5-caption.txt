a, The average intensity projection of the OCT scan along A-scan direction (frontal view of the eye) is overlaid with a thickness map of the fibrovascular pigment epithelium detachment (PED, red segment). b, Screenshot from our OCT viewer. First row (left), referral suggestion, tissue volumes and diagnosis probabilities. The highlighted bars correspond to the selected segmentation model. First–third rows, thickness maps of the 10 relevant tissue types from segmentation model instance 2. The two healthy tissue types (high level retina and RPE) are displayed in a black–blue–green–brown–white color map, the pathological tissues (all others) are displayed as overlay on a projection of the raw OCT scan. The thin white line indicates the position of slice 80. Fourth row, slice 80 from the OCT scan and the segmentation map from segmentation model instance 2. Detailed tissue legend in Supplementary Table 2. The slice and model instance can be interactively selected (see Supplementary Video 1).
