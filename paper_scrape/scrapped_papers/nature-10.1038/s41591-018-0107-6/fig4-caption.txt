a, Low performance of original network on OCT scans from the new device type 2. Left, the selected slice shows the different appearance of structures in device type 2. Middle, a poor quality segmentation map created with our original segmentation network (color legend in Supplementary Table 2). Right, resulting performance on a new test set of n = 116 patients. The confusion matrix shows patient numbers for the referral suggestion. b, All five segmentation hypotheses from our original network. The strong variations show the large uncertainty. c, High performance was attained on the device type 2 test set (n = 116) after retraining the segmentation network with OCT scans from device type 1 and device type 2. The classification network is unchanged. d, All five segmentation hypotheses from the retrained segmentation network. The network is confident in the interpretation of most structures, and just highlights the ambiguities in the sub-retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) space. Scale bars: 0.5 mm.
